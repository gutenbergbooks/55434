<h2 id="c1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>Since the time of Columbus, when the peoples of the
New World were discovered by Europeans, there has
been a continuous interest in knowing something about
their origin and early history. This has been almost
completely shrouded in the primitive past, unmentioned
in any written records, and thus largely a matter
of speculation of one kind or another. Only very
slowly have the means of investigating this history
come into being. Greater knowledge of all the world&rsquo;s
peoples has provided the means for solidly based comparative
studies, and the developing techniques of archaeology
have brought more factual evidence to
hand. Gradually the true picture is taking shape as
each new discovery is analyzed and discussed and
takes its place in the total structure.</p>
<p>This is an exciting adventure in discovery and learning
that many would like to share more completely
with the archaeologist and anthropologist. Usually,
however, the reports of the professionals are too technical
to be meaningfully understood by the layman,
and the brief accounts of &ldquo;finds&rdquo; and &ldquo;digs&rdquo; that appear
in the press are far too fragmentary. Most fortunately,
<span class="pb" id="Page_x">x</span>
we have the present book, which fills the need very
nicely&mdash;far better than anything else in print.</p>
<p>Kenneth Macgowan professes to be an amateur in
archaeological matters and, technically speaking, he is,
although his competence in the extraordinarily involved
subject he deals with is certainly of professional
stature. In any event, he clearly discerns what is
needed by the amateur and, without minimizing the
complexities and involved problems of his subject, he
provides the background to make them understandable.
To incorporate the various discoveries and new
formulations that have appeared in the twelve years
since this book was first published, the text has been
revised and brought up to date, largely by Professor
Joseph A. Hester, Jr. This has been skillfully done in
a way that does not alter the quality or coverage of
the original.</p>
<p>I have been recommending this book for many years
and now begin a new series of such recommendations.
I am sure that it will be enjoyed and found most illuminating
by all who want to know how the early history
of man in the New World is being revealed.</p>

<h2 id="c2">PREFACE</h2>
<p>In the twelve years since <i>Early Man in the New World</i>
appeared, in 1950, a good deal of archaeological water
has passed under the bridge&mdash;or over the land-bridge
that led the first immigrants into the Americas. Because
I had given most of these years to the founding
and development of the Department of Theater Arts
at U.C.L.A., I was in no position to revise and add to
that book without the collaboration of an able and willing
anthropologist, a man who had followed far more
closely than I the new findings in American prehistory,
and the new theories, or guesses, about their meanings.
I was fortunate indeed to find such a man in Professor
Joseph A. Hester, Jr., of the Department of Sociology
and Anthropology, San Jose State College, California.
To him must go the fullest credit for the updating and
the correcting, too, of a twelve-year-old book. Through
him, <i>Early Man in the New World</i> is now able to present
a great deal of information that was not in existence
in 1950. Then, for example, the dating of wood
and charcoal, bone, horn, and shell, through radiocarbon
was hardly more than a gleam in the eye of Willard
F. Libby. As I was reading page proof when he
<span class="pb" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
announced his first pre-Columbian date, I could mention
this invaluable time clock only at the end of three
chapters. A change, rather than an addition to the text,
is the use of the word &ldquo;Clovis&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Generalized
Folsom,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Eden&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;Yuma,&rdquo; thus bringing
our terminology in line with today&rsquo;s practice.</p>
<p>In its first form, the book came about almost by accident.
During 1941 and 1942, my work in the Office of
the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs included the
preparation of some educational films upon archaeological
work in Mexico and South America. As a result
I came to know and esteem the Director of the University
Museum, George C. Vaillant. To my surprise and
pleasure, when he learned of my interest in American
archaeology, he proposed that we collaborate on a prehistory
of the New World. When the war prevented
active work together by taking him to Peru, I prepared
what would have been the first two chapters of our
book&mdash;the place of early man in the story of pre-Columbian
America. Upon Vaillant&rsquo;s untimely death, I
decided to study the subject more intensively, to add
material on the Great Ice Age and early man in the
Old World, and to expand the two chapters into a book
that I might dedicate to the man who had done so
much for American archaeology in the twenty years of
his work&mdash;George C. Vaillant.</p>
<p>Since the book was not the result of personal work
in the field, but rather the product of the kind of research
that is nothing more than reading and talking,
I was in the debt of many men and books, and a welter
of papers, pamphlets, and periodicals. I found it hard
to believe that in any other branch of science so many
overworked men and women would be so ready to give
their time to talk and correspondence with the amateur.
I was deeply indebted to more than two score
who had gone out of their way to answer questions,
lend books, or give reprints of papers. In listing them
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
I was more than certain that I had inadvertently
omitted some: Edgar Anderson, Ernst Antevs, Ralph
L. Beals, Junius Bird, Robert J. Braidwood, Henry J.
Bruman, Kirk Bryan, George F. Carter, R. A. Daly,
Helmut de Terra, Loren C. Eiseley, Richard F. Flint,
James Gilluly, Harold S. Gladwin, M. R. Harrington,
Frank C. Hibben, Frederick W. Hodge, Harry Hoijer,
Earnest A. Hooton, W. W. Howells, Frederick R.
Johnson, Arthur R. Kelly, G. H. R. von Koenigswald,
Alex D. Krieger, Alfred L. Kroeber, M. M. Leighton,
Theodore D. McCown, George G. MacCurdy, P. C.
Mangelsdorf, Paul S. Martin, Hallam L. Movius, Jr.,
Raymond W. Murray, N. C. Nelson, Charles W. Phillips,
Cyrus N. Ray, E. B. Renaud, Frank H. H. Roberts,
Jr., Alfred S. Romer, Irving Rouse, Curt Sachs, Carl O.
Sauer, E. H. Sellards, Herbert J. Spinden, T. D. Stewart,
Wm. Duncan Strong, Griffith Taylor, Bella Weitzner,
H. M. Wormington, and Clark Wissler.</p>
<p>Next to the scientists who provide knowledge stand
the librarians who help to preserve it and make it usable.
I was peculiarly indebted to a number of these:
Miss Margaret Currier, Librarian of the Peabody Museum,
Cambridge; her assistant Miss Jessie Bell MacKenzie;
Mrs. Ella L. Robinson, Librarian of the Southwest
Museum; Dr. Lawrence C. Powell, Librarian of
the University of California at Los Angeles; his most
cooperative staff; and particularly one of its members,
Miss Hilda M. Gray, whose expeditions into the equal
mysteries of stacks and bibliographies saved me many
hours of labor and I can&rsquo;t guess how many blunders.
Professor Hester and I add a warm word of thanks to
Mrs. Alice De Lisle for assembling data, preparing
charts, typing, filing, and research.</p>
<p>I was particularly indebted to Frank H. H. Roberts,
Jr., of the Smithsonian Institution, the outstanding authority
on early man in North America, for his reading,
checking, and challenging of the manuscript, and to
<span class="pb" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
M. R. Harrington, who read and criticized my first
draft. I also owed much to a number of men and
women who read various chapters on which they had
special knowledge: Edgar Anderson, Ernst Antevs,
Robert J. Braidwood, Henry J. Bruman, Loren C. Easeley,
James Gilluly, Harold S. Gladwin, M. R. Harrington,
Robert F. Heizer, Earnest A. Hooton, Alex
Krieger, Alfred L. Kroeber, Theodore D. McCown, Ernest
S. Macgowan, Hallam L. Movius, Jr., and H. M.
Wormington.</p>
<p>Both Professor Hester and I are especially obliged to
Campbell Grant, amateur of anthropology as well as
artist, for the many illustrations.</p>
<p>Finally, in the typing of the original manuscript and
the checking of the many references I was fortunate in
having the aid of Miss Frankie Porter and of Joe
Pavalko.</p>
<p>Since we are not adding a repetitive bibliography to
the almost four hundred references that we cite, we
should like to list a few of the sources which we have
found most useful and which should prove so to any

a nuisance and always a typographical eyesore.
The reference numbers in this book direct
attention only to the sources of quotations,
facts, or theories. They do not lead the

<h3>A Secret Laboratory of Culture</h3>
<p>By the end of World
War II, Timbuctoo was surprisingly close to Keokuk.
Boys from Brooklyn stared up at Roman columns in
the African desert, and Marines swapped a package
of cigarettes for the spear of a stone-age man in New
Guinea. Physically ours was indeed one world.</p>
<p>In a different sense it was one world before Columbus
sailed, but a very limited world. Europe, North
Africa, and portions of Asia made up all that Columbus
knew and all that he expected to know. He intended
to find a new road to the Indies; that was all.
It would be a road across his own one world.</p>
<p>Then suddenly this world of his was two worlds. A
new hemisphere appeared like a comet from outer
space. It was a land and a people utterly unknown,
utterly different. It had lived and grown for thousands
upon thousands of years, sealed off to itself, unique.
We search for some fit comparison, and find nothing
adequate to describe the discovery of this secret laboratory
of experiment in human culture.</p>
<p>Perhaps we should not have said that the New
World had been &ldquo;sealed off to itself.&rdquo; We might better
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
have said &ldquo;sealed off from Europe.&rdquo; The culture which
the Spanish Conquistadores found in the Americas
owed nothing to that world from which they had come.
What the Americas owed to Asia is another matter&mdash;in
fact, the matter of this book.</p>
<p>One thing is clear. The Americas were indebted to
Asia for man himself. Man&mdash;even one type of man&mdash;did
not originate here. A small primate, the extinct Notharctus,
left his bones&mdash;but no descendants&mdash;in our
Southwest. The New World has no great apes; there
are no indications that it ever had any. Its monkeys
are quite out of the running. They have four too many
teeth, their nose is flat, and they are cursed with a prehensile
tail.</p>
<p>The New World owed something more to Asia, of
course; but how much, is uncertain. Most anthropologists
believe that man crossed Bering Strait with a very
meager kit of material culture. He brought, at various
times, the spear-thrower, the bow and arrow, the dog,
the boat, the strike-a-light, some kind of clothing, but
not a great deal more. Many other things&mdash;pottery,
weaving, agriculture, masonry, metallurgy&mdash;he had to
invent for himself in the New World; at least, that is
the general opinion. A few anthropologists say that
men out of Asia brought quite an array of culture traits;
but these migrants were late comers, and some of them
crossed the Pacific by boat.</p>
<p>Only a few students now deny that men had been
crossing over from Asia through twenty or more millenniums
before the birth of Christ. Some of them were
what we call Indians&mdash;most of them, no doubt; but, before
the Indians came, there seem to have been other
immigrants. It is the purpose of this book to tell you
what is known or believed or hazarded about these
earliest men of the New World.</p>
<p>There are two chief problems: When did these men
come? and What were they like?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<p>It is a curious fact that, if we look at the rich variety
of men and languages and cultures which was spread
from end to end of two whole continents when the
European came, we get some vague idea of how long
man had been in the western hemisphere but no idea
at all of what he was like when he anticipated Columbus
by discovering the New World. Through the haze
of time, we can see the general outline of Indian civilization,
and many details. Much of this is clear and concrete,
most of it is natural and understandable in terms
of our Americas, and all of it is striking and extraordinary.
But, for our present purposes, the best it does is
to tell us that many millenniums of time must have
been required for its development. It tells us nothing
about the men who preceded the Indian, the primitive
savages who discovered the New World. These men
who first journeyed from Bering Strait to Cape Horn
were not the men who made the Maya civilization,
and they came long, long before. But by studying both
the Indian and his predecessors we may gain some hint
of how long ago this was.</p>
<h3>Time-Tests by Travel, Tongues, and Physiques</h3>
<p>Somehow
or other, by this route or that, the migrants from
Asia drifted across to the Americas, down the two continents,
and out to their uttermost limits. Of the many
possible tests of man&rsquo;s age in the New World&mdash;some
good, some not so good&mdash;one of the least accurate is a
guess at how long it would take men and women, encumbered
with children, to walk&mdash;and to eat their way&mdash;from
Bering Strait to Cape Horn. It has been estimated
that they might have covered the 4,000 miles
from Harbin, Manchuria, to Vancouver Island in from
20 to 1,000 years; the time involved really depends on
how fast and in what direction those wild animals
moved upon which early man depended for food. As
the country widened out, then narrowed in Central
America, and widened out once more, there is no
knowing how long the trip to Cape Horn may have
taken. Our migrants would have had to camp and hunt
as they went, and at first they would have moved only
as the pursuit of game spurred them on. There would
have had to be time, too, for increase in numbers&mdash;among
themselves as well as among later invaders&mdash;to
create pressure of population, and force the earlier men
to the peripheries of northeastern America, Florida,
and Lower California, and push them across jungled
Panama and Amazonia and toward the bleaker and less
desirable parts of South America. The various invaders
multiplied as they moved, and it is anybody&rsquo;s guess
how many people were crowded into America by
1492; one authority says 8,400,000, another 50,000,000
to 75,000,000.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_1" href="#fn_1_1">[1]</a> It took much time, of course&mdash;many
millenniums&mdash;to breed so many men and cover so wide
a space.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_5">5</div>
<p>Other things suggest a long sojourn for the Indian in
the New World. Consider the matter of language&mdash;&ldquo;the
archives of history.&rdquo; The Indian, writes N. C. Nelson,
&ldquo;had been at home in the New World long enough to
have evolved about 160 linguistic stocks or language
families, with 1,200 or more dialectic subdivisions.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_2" href="#fn_1_2">[2]</a>
Alfred L. Kroeber says that North and South America
&ldquo;contain more native language families than all the remainder
of the world.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_3" href="#fn_1_3">[3]</a> Some of this diversity could
be due to migrations from different linguistic areas of
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the Old World. It might also be accounted for by the
theory of Franz Boas that among early primitive peoples
there was great diversity of language, and that
single tongues began to spread widely only when conquering
and proselyting groups won a certain amount
of power and dominion.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_4" href="#fn_1_4">[4]</a> John Harrington, an American
linguistic authority, believes that the diversity of
Indian speech argues a very long residence in the New
World&mdash;&ldquo;at least 20,000 years, perhaps three times
that.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_5" href="#fn_1_5">[5]</a> Edgar B. Howard states: &ldquo;Considering that the
languages of the New World lack evidence, outside of
Eskimo, of any identification with Old World languages,
the conclusion appears to be that human contact
between the two continents was very remote.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_6" href="#fn_1_6">[6]</a>
If there is no such identification, then even the last migrants
came at a very early date indeed, or else all the
tribal relatives who were left behind in the Old World
perished without linguistic trace. It is possible, of
course, that resemblances have merely not been recognized.</p>
<p>In addition to differentiation of language, there is
differentiation of physique. When we in the United
States think of the Indian, we think of a tall man with
high cheekbones, a hawk-nose, and a bronze-red skin.
Actually the American Indian is probably more varied
in height, face, and color than the whole White racial
stock.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_7" href="#fn_1_7">[7]</a> More than that, his somatic constitution&mdash;the
inner man in a physical sense&mdash;varies greatly. By 1492
the Indian had adapted himself to eight different climates
from arctic to tropic, from arid to humid, from
sea level to the 14,000-foot heights of Peru. This would
take time, much time. Albrecht Penck, the great European
glacialist, thinks 25,000 years hardly long
enough.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_8" href="#fn_1_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>The civilizations which the Indian developed in the
Americas&mdash;the Maya, Aztec, and Inca cultures&mdash;provide
another test of how long man had been in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
New World before Columbus came. This test is no
more exact than those we have already mentioned,
but it suggests quite a long sojourn.</p>
<h3>From the Old Stone Age to the New</h3>
<p>While the physical
man was adapting himself to all manner of climates,
the mental man dragged himself up from the
hunting life of the Old Stone Age to the invention of
writing and the perfecting of an accurate calendar. On
the way&mdash;and as slow, necessary steps in his progress&mdash;he
developed agriculture, and invented or perfected
the arts and crafts of pottery, weaving, dyeing, metallurgy,
sculpture, poetry, painting, architecture, city
planning. In his agriculture he utilized irrigation, discovered
fertilizers, and developed a great many exclusively
American plants which now supply more than
half of the world&rsquo;s provender. He was probably the first
to write numbers effectively through the use of zero
and numerical position. He practiced trepanning&mdash;the
removal of a piece of skull bone to relieve pressure on
the brain&mdash;and he discovered how to use certain medicines
and narcotics. In his textiles he employed all the
weaves known to us today. He contrived efficient
methods of government. He proliferated into 368 major
tribal groups, and developed fifteen culture centers of
distinct individuality.<a class="fn" id="fr_1_9" href="#fn_1_9">[9]</a> In the United States he left
100,000 mounds as the product of one of his cultures;
in Middle America, 4,000 ceremonial cities of stone. He
practiced most types of religion except atheism. Certain
things that he made resemble things of the Old
World; most are peculiar to him and his life. Of Indian
culture traits Clark Wissler remarks that &ldquo;the range in
variety and individuality seems even greater in aboriginal
America than in the primitive Old World.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_1_10" href="#fn_1_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Progress is slow in the stone age. It seems to have
been particularly slow in the Old Stone Age, or paleolithic
period, when man spent half a million to a million
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
years learning to chip stone and hunt and gather
food efficiently. Things went much faster in the New
Stone Age, or neolithic period, when he was learning
to cultivate plants and make pottery and polish stone
tools. To move from the beginnings of agriculture to
the beginnings of metallurgy, which superseded the
neolithic, may have taken as little as 700 years in the
Old World and certainly not much more than 4,000 or
5,000.</p>
<p>Progress was slower in the New World. The Indian
reached the neolithic stage later, and he may have
stayed in it longer than man did in the Old World. This
can probably be blamed on the peculiar fauna of the
western hemisphere. In all of the Americas there were
no suitable animals to domesticate except the dog&mdash;which
the Indian probably brought with him&mdash;and
those dubious objects of husbandry, the turkey, the
bee, the Muscovy duck, the llama, the alpaca, the
vicu&ntilde;a, and the guinea pig. Because there were no
sheep or cattle, the Indian had no pastoral life and no
milk and butter. He had no beasts of burden except the
dog and the llama; he invented no wheeled cart. It
was not entirely his own fault that he remained essentially
a man of the stone age even though, toward the
last, he had perfected a metallurgy of copper, silver,
gold, platinum, and bronze.</p>
<p>The story of the Indian&rsquo;s spread through the Americas,
his variation in language and physique, and his
building of the civilizations of Peru, Central America,
and Mexico argues that he came to the New World
many millenniums before the birth of Christ. You may
point out that the argument is too general, too inexact
in outcome, but you must remember that behind the
Indian lies an earlier migrant. We are on somewhat
firmer ground when we turn to the evidence we have
of this migrant&rsquo;s tools, his hearths, and his bones. For
sometimes they are related to the fossils of extinct
<span class="pb" id="Page_9">9</span>
mammals and&mdash;more important&mdash;to certain kinds of
earth, charcoal and rock that can be dated.</p>
<h3>From Tools and Bones, Fossils and Rocks</h3>
<p>The tools
and the hearths and the fossils are plentiful, and some
years ago this proof of man&rsquo;s antiquity seemed to be
enough. The great and spectacular mammals whose remains
were associated with early man in the Americas,
as well as in Europe, were thought to have vanished
with the glaciers of the Great Ice Age. Therefore, early
man in the Americas must also have lived in that period.
Now, however, a number of scientists believe that
the American mastodon, along with a number of other
animals that are now extinct in the New World, survived
the Great Ice Age here. This would still leave us
with an American whose antiquity is quite respectable.</p>
<p>The best proof of the age of early man was for a
long time geological. Archaeologists dated man by the
earth and rocks in which they found his tools or his
bones. Unfortunately, they had not too much geological
evidence in the Americas. In the past ten years,
however, radiocarbon (of which you will learn more
later) has made it possible to know much about when
man reached the New World and where he lived.</p>

<br />THE ROAD OF EARLY MAN</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>I have been a stranger in a strange land.</i>
<span class="lr">&mdash;<span class="small">EXODUS</span> 2:22</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>How New Was the New World?</h3>
<p>We moderns were
not the first to ask the question: Just how new was the
New World on October 12, 1492? Or how old?</p>
<p>For a time, it was a very ancient world to the Spaniards.
It was the Indies of the East, and they thought
they had discovered nothing more than a new way of
getting at them. Some years passed before they awoke
to the fact that they had found a new continent. There
may, of course, have been suspicions from the first. Certainly
the tropical trees and plants were new; the animals,
too, all except man. Man was an Indian&mdash;that is,
an East Indian. Balboa may have had a &ldquo;wild surmise,&rdquo;
but it remained for later Spaniards, as well as the Portuguese,
to find in South America a land that could not
be Asia. Columbus discovered the New World and
thought it was India; the Italian Amerigo Vespucci did
not discover the continent named for him, but at least
he knew it was not India and gave it a name of its
own&mdash;<i>Mundus Novus</i>.</p>
<p>Then, indeed, our world became a new world, and
a world freighted with a problem. The problem was
how to put its inhabitants into a proper theological&mdash;and
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
ethnological&mdash;pigeonhole. As a new and unknown
being, the Indian presented a serious issue to the
Catholic Church and its clerical and imperial pioneers.
Here was a people of whom the Bible made no mention.
Shem, Ham, and Japheth had filled three continents
very handily, but they had somehow neglected
this one. Established authority had no explanation for
these new men. Were they, indeed, beings without
souls? &ldquo;While the New World with its gold and other
riches was accepted as reality,&rdquo; observes N. C. Nelson,
&ldquo;the truly human nature of its inhabitants was temporarily
held in doubt.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_1" href="#fn_2_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Soon, however, the church found an explanation.
The Bible mentioned no separate creation in an American
Garden of Eden; therefore the forebears of the red
man must have come from the Old World. As early as
1512 Pope Julius II declared officially that the Indians
were descended from Adam and Eve. For many years
thereafter they were considered as children of Babel
driven back into the stone age because of their sins.</p>
<h3>A Passage from Asia to North America</h3>
<p>In 1590&mdash;not
quite a hundred years after Columbus&rsquo;s discovery&mdash;a
Spanish cleric, Jos&eacute; de Acosta, put on paper an ingenious
theory for the populating of the Americas. In an
English translation of 1604, it reads:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is not likely that there was another Noes Arke, by
the which men might be transported into the Indies,
and much lesse any Angell to carie the first man to this
new world, holding him by the haire of the head, like
to the Prophet Abacuc.... I conclude then, that it
is likely the first that came to the Indies was by ship-wracke
and tempest of wether.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_2" href="#fn_2_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>But Acosta felt the need of a land route to take care
of the animals. Noah had let them out of the Ark in
western Asia, and they could hardly be expected to
sail or even to swim to America. And so Acosta ventured
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
the opinion that somewhere in the north explorers
would ultimately find a portion of America that
joined with some corner of the Old World, or at any
rate was &ldquo;not altogether severed and disjoined&rdquo; from
it. In this way the animals&mdash;and man&mdash;had come to the
New World.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig2">

<p class="caption">OUT OF NOAH&rsquo;S ARK AND OVER BERING STRAIT</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Two pages from Brerewood&rsquo;s seventeenth-century book</i>
Enquiries Touching the Diversity of Languages, and Religions,
Through the Chief Parts of the World, <i>in which he
pictures bears and Tartars crossing to the New World at
a point where Asia and America &ldquo;are continent one with
the other, or at most, disioyned but by some narrow channell
of the Ocean.&rdquo; (Courtesy of the University of California,
Los Angeles, Library</i>.)</p>
</div>
<p>God-fearing Protestants from England joined clerics
of the Roman church in bringing the American aborigine
over from Asia. Long before any white man had
stared across Bering Strait from the eastern tip of Asia
and discovered Alaska, sixteenth and seventeenth century
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
men were envisioning the neighborliness of the
two continents and an easy crossing. It had to be. There
was no escaping this solution. Men from Eden could
be trusted to force their way across the widest and
wildest of oceans, but not animals from Ararat. In 1614
Edward Brerewood worried, like Father de Acosta,
over the problem of &ldquo;the ravenous and harmefull
beasts, wherewith <i>America</i> is stored, as Beares, Lions,
Tigers, Wolves, Foxes, &amp;c. (which men as is likely,
would never to their owne harme transport out of the
one continent to the other).&rdquo; He saw that &ldquo;from <i>Noahs</i>
Ark, which rested after the deluge, in <i>Asia</i>, all those
beasts must of necessity fetch their beginning.&rdquo; He
knew that the men must have come from Asia because
the Indians were not the color of Africans, and
they had &ldquo;no rellish nor resemblance at all, of the Artes,
or learning, or civility of <i>Europe</i>.&rdquo; Also, &ldquo;the West side
of <i>America</i> respecting <i>Asia</i>, is exceeding much better
peopled then the opposite or East side, that respecteth
toward Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Men Out of Asia&mdash;and All the Continents</h3>
<p>Brerewood
moved on from the questions of how and whence to
who. With considerable hardihood, this learned Englishman
picked a single Asiatic race to supply the Indian
with a forebear. Looking askance at the inhabitants
of America, he wrote: &ldquo;In their grosse ignorance
of letters, and of arts, in their idolatrie, and the specialties
of it, in their incivility, and many barbarous properties,
they resemble the old and rude Tartars, above all
the nations of the earth.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_3" href="#fn_2_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Brerewood&rsquo;s reasoning was logic itself and his conclusion
inescapable compared with much of the theorizing
of his day and much more that went on for three
hundred years after the discovery of America. In 1607
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
Fray Gregorio Garcia published a book, <i>The Origin of
the Indians of the New World</i>, in which appeared
these words:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Indians proceed neither from one nation or people,
nor have they come from one part alone of the
Old World, or by the same road, or at the same time,
in the same way, or for the same reasons; some have
probably descended from the Carthaginians, others
from the Ten Lost Tribes and other Israelites, others
from the lost Atlantis, from the Greeks, and Phoenicians,
and still others from the Chinese, Tartars, and
other groups.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_4" href="#fn_2_4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For good measure, Fray Garc&iacute;a and his fellow theorists
threw in men of Ophir and Tarsus, old Spaniards,
Romans, Japanese, Koreans, Egyptians, Moors, Canary
Islanders, Ethiopians, French, English, Irish, Germans,
Trojans, Danes, Frisians, and Norsemen&mdash;a veritable
League of Nations.</p>
<p>Iconoclastic Voltaire would have none of this&mdash;and
none of Eden, either:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can it still be asked from whence came the men
who people America? The same question might be
asked with regard to the Terra Australis. They are
much farther distant from the port which Columbus
set out from, than the Antilles. Men and beasts have
been found in all parts of the earth that are inhabitable.
Who placed them there? We have already answered
He that caused the grass to grow in the fields;
and it is no more surprising to find men in America,
than it is to find flies there.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_5" href="#fn_2_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The more or less scientific minds of the nineteenth
and twentieth centuries were no less prodigal in theory
than the clerics and the philosophers of the seventeenth
and eighteenth. Sometime in the 1820&rsquo;s Lord Kingsborough,
son of an Irish peer of great wealth, got it into
his head that the Lost Tribes of Israel were the ancestors
of the Maya and the Aztecs&mdash;the same idea that
animated Joseph Smith and <i>The Book of Mormon</i>; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
in 1830&mdash;the very year that Smith&rsquo;s American supplement
to the Bible appeared&mdash;Kingsborough began the
publication of the nine monumental and handsomely
illustrated volumes, <i>Antiquities of Mexico</i>, which cost
him &pound;25,000 and ultimately&mdash;like Smith&mdash;his life. Quite
as eccentric theories followed. The otherwise sound
and observant George Catlin thought the Mandan Indians
the descendants of the Welsh. The &ldquo;lost continent&rdquo;
of Mu&mdash;the Atlantis of the Pacific&mdash;reared its ugly
head. Elliot Smith left the teaching of anatomy, and
W. J. Perry cultural anthropology and comparative religions,
to bring from Egypt all the culture of America&mdash;together
with most of Eurasia&rsquo;s and Africa&rsquo;s&mdash;on the
backs of those indefatigable travelers of their invention,
the Children of the Sun.</p>
<p>In the face of such wild theorizing it is comforting to
recall that the great Humboldt recognized as early as
1811 a &ldquo;striking analogy between the Americans and
the Mongol race.&rdquo; We must pardon him for clinging to
some vague notion of a primordial American race and
declaring that the Indians were &ldquo;a mixture of Asiatic
tribes and the aborigines of this vast continent.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_6" href="#fn_2_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Today science does not have all the answers to the
anthropological problem which arose when Balboa discovered
the Pacific and Magellan crossed it, thus dropping
the world&rsquo;s largest ocean in between the Americas
and the Garden of Eden. So far as early man is concerned,
we know a good deal about how he came, and
whence, and a little about when.</p>
<p>Except for the passionate protagonists of Atlantis
and of its &ldquo;opposite number,&rdquo; the mythical land of Mu
lost in the depths of the Pacific, most students agree
that early man came across what is now Bering Strait&mdash;not
by way of the Aleutians, for their inhospitable
western tip is separated from Asia by 225 miles of sea
with one small island midway between. For a long
time, the Bering Strait route was supported only by
<span class="pb" id="Page_17">17</span>
<i>a priori</i> reasoning, but of late years the weapons of
early man have been found either alone or with the
fossils of extinct mammals in parts of Alaska and north-west
Canada.</p>
<h3>Bering Strait&mdash;Freeway to the New World</h3>
<p>Though
early man from northern Asia certainly crossed in one
area and in one area only, he may have made the crossing
by any one of three methods. That depends on
when he came.</p>
<p>If he came rather late&mdash;say around 10,000 years ago&mdash;he
had to negotiate Bering Strait, open water in summer,
iced over in winter. If the migrants were a boating
and fishing people voyaging north along the Asiatic
shore, the 56-mile gap of Bering Strait, broken by the
Diomede Islands, was a negligible barrier, since the
greatest stretch of open water was only 23 miles across.
If they found the strait frozen over, they would have
followed the southern edge of the ice. Men of a more
inland type, men less given to water travel, could have
crossed to Alaska&mdash;as some do now&mdash;on the ice of
winter.</p>
<p>If early man first came to the New World in the
Great Ice Age or in the time when the glaciers were
beginning to melt, he could have crossed dry-shod on
a land-bridge. Geologists have calculated that the
water withdrawn from the ocean to form the glaciers&mdash;which
were half a mile to two miles thick over much
of Canada and the northern portion of the United
States&mdash;would have lowered the water level in the Bering
Strait region by as much as 200 to 300 feet toward
the end of the Great Ice Age.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_7" href="#fn_2_7">[7]</a> In addition, the ocean
floor of the strait&mdash;relieved of so much weight of water&mdash;would
doubtless have risen to some extent. Since, at
present, portions of the strait reaching from shore to
shore are not more than 120 feet deep, a land-bridge
is a perfectly plausible hypothesis. Of course the bridge
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
would have disappeared with the end of the glaciers,
which means that, if man had to come over dry-shod
in the summer, he must have invaded America while
the glaciers were still fairly extensive.</p>

path of early man across Asia to the New World seems a
roundabout curve. On a globe, it is very nearly a great
circle. This is indicated on a map such as this, projected
from a point above the North Pole. From above Bering
Strait, the route would appear still straighter.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Ale&#353; Hrdli&#269;ka has said that not many men would
have frequented northeastern Siberia because of its inhospitable
climate, and so only a few would have
&ldquo;trickled over.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_8" href="#fn_2_8">[8]</a> The opposite seems to have been true
in the time of the glaciers. Then northeastern Asia was
an excellent jumping-off place for the Old World migrant.
In the first place, there was not much glaciation
in this area, certainly nothing to interfere with the passage
of people along the coast. The last glaciation was
&ldquo;far less extensive than its predecessor,&rdquo; say R. F. Flint
and H. G. Dorsey, &ldquo;and was confined to the higher
parts of the higher mountain ranges.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_9" href="#fn_2_9">[9]</a> Secondly, the
land-bridge, which made crossing easy, also altered the
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
climate of Siberia south of the bridge.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_10" href="#fn_2_10">[10]</a> It cut off the
arctic currents and therefore to some extent the arctic
damp which now makes the Asiatic coast inhospitable.
Hrdli&#269;ka&mdash;one of the first and most violent opponents
of early man in America&mdash;said that the land-bridge was
not essential. Even if it had existed, &ldquo;man would not
have used it, but would have followed the much easier
route over the water.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_11" href="#fn_2_11">[11]</a></p>

Alaska, man&mdash;early or not so early&mdash;had a number of
routes to choose from. If he was of maritime habits,
and crossed by water, he would have tended to stick to
his boats, and sail or paddle southward and southeastward
down the coast and on through the inland passages
of lower Alaska and Canada which protect boats
from ocean storms. When Frank C. Hibben found a
certain early kind of spear point in a curio shop in
Ketchikan, Alaska, and on the far-away shore of Cook
Inlet, he called attention to a route&mdash;whether overland
or by sea&mdash;which hardly anyone had stressed except
Hrdli&#269;ka.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_12" href="#fn_2_12">[12]</a> Hrdli&#269;ka stressed it because he brought
man over after the glaciers and in boats. But even in the
Great Ice Age this route was not impossible for men
without boats. Migrants who had crossed by a land-bridge
might have turned south along the Pacific shore,
climbing and crossing the ice barriers of the glacial
rivers that still slide slowly down from the inland
mountains. Philip S. Smith points out that &ldquo;ice surfaces
allow fully as easy travel by sled and on foot as do the
ordinary land surfaces.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2_13" href="#fn_2_13">[13]</a> But was there game, as well
as fish, along the coast to lure the migrant on and to
sustain him upon the journey?</p>
<p>Other men seem to have chosen to tramp and hunt
eastward and northeastward from the strait. In this direction
there were two main routes open to men and
game. One route led up the narrow lowlands of the
<span class="pb" id="Page_21">21</span>
northwest coast to the mouth of the Mackenzie River
and then south up its long valley. The other, and much
more likely path for early man, was up the ice-free
Yukon and its tributaries. These would have taken him
eastward to the Mackenzie or southward through the
plateau between the northern Rockies and the Coastal
Range. Hrdli&#269;ka thought the Yukon valley a most unpromising
route because of the turbulent rivers and the
noxious insects; but most students disagree with him
and stress the abundance of fish and game. There can
be no question that some parts of this route were used
by early man&mdash;and extinct mammals, too. His ancient
spear points have been found in the muck beds of Fairbanks
mingled with the fossilized bones of elephant,
bison, camel, horse, and an extinct jaguar once called
the Alaskan lion.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_14" href="#fn_2_14">[14]</a> Other early points have been discovered
in western Canada in the area of the mountain
plateau. In 1944 Frederick Johnson located fifteen
camp sites in early soil levels along the route of the
plateau corridor and found many varieties of artifacts.
Among these were a few points, most of them fragmentary,
the butts of which resembled those of an early
type.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_15" href="#fn_2_15">[15]</a> Following Johnson in 1945, Douglas Leechman
found other sites and artifacts along this route in soils
formed perhaps 9,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_16" href="#fn_2_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The Yukon valley rivers could have taken early man
to the Mackenzie and to the northern edge of the plateau;
but during a large part of the Great Ice Age he
still faced the gigantic fields of snow and ice that covered
half of North America. Although ice journeys may
not be so very difficult, and early man had learned to
live in the chill of northern Siberia (the Eskimo of today
proves that human existence is possible in a land
of little sun and much cold), we cannot believe that he
attempted to cross the icy wastes. A journey on foot
across a thousand or two thousand miles of ice becomes
a sheer impossibility if there is no provender to be
found along the way. There was certainly no food for
musk ox or mammoth, and therefore no food for man.
Without game to hunt, he would not have felt the impulse
to invade the ice fields.</p>

<p class="caption">MIGRATION ROUTES</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>The pathways available to early man, as mapped by Carl
Sauer&mdash;to which have been added a problematical route by
sea along the southern coast of Alaska and another down
the corridor between the eastern Rockies in Canada and
the coastal range. (After Sauer, 1944.)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Too many authorities have written as if early man
made a free choice of routes through Alaska and
Canada. Actually, the animals he hunted chose his
route for him&mdash;doubtless many routes. Unless he had
learned to spear and net fish, the first invader probably
pursued a herd of mammoth or musk ox across the
land-bridge or over the frozen ice of later winters. You
in your armchair are likely to suggest that, once man
was in Alaska, he turned south of his own free will
and intelligence in order to avoid the cold. The first
trouble with that line of thought is that man had gone
north in Asia. The second is that primitive man had
no conception of where south lay or of the possibility
of greater comfort there. At this point, you will probably
say that, though he had no ideas about the nature
of the south, he had brains enough to follow the sun.
Unfortunately this would have spun him round like a
slow-motion teetotum; for he entered North America
in the neighborhood of the Arctic Circle where the
summer sun moves in a great low circle, and sinks out
of sight when winter sets in.</p>
<p>If you want to understand early man, and guess with
some accuracy at why he came to the New World and
how he happened to drift southward and eastward until
he filled it, you must think of him as a wanderer
looking for food. Game lured him on at random, and
vegetation lured both beast and man. Man might eat
his way through caribou country, and come upon the
bison of another area. As he killed and wandered, he
might go south or he might go east. But the animal&mdash;and
the man who ate berries and roots and wild grains
as well as meat&mdash;would move as the climate moved.
The world has known many changes of climate and
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
shifts of rain belts. Some of these have been extreme&mdash;in
the Great Ice Age, for example&mdash;and some have been
less marked. But they have moved the forests and the
grasslands, and animals and man have moved with the
vegetation.</p>
<p>During the past 100,000 years, glacialists believe that
there were three periods when the inland ice melted
sufficiently to allow the southward passage of both
animals and man. The first was more than 75,000 years
ago in the Sangamon Interglacial period before the
time when the last, or Wisconsin, glaciation had covered
the plains of Canada (see pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_26">26</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_27">27</a>). During
the Wisconsin, a corridor probably opened about
50,000 years ago along the eastern foothills of the
Rockies, and another, perhaps a little later, down the
plateau between the northern Rockies and the Coast
Range. The third opportunity for man to penetrate
from the north came around 11,000 years ago, when
the final retreat of the ice sheets began in those same
regions.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_17" href="#fn_2_17">[17]</a> Perhaps the land-bridge was still usable up
to 10,000 years ago, but certainly later migrants had to
cross Bering Strait by water or winter ice.</p>
<p>Bering Strait and the great glaciers were not the
only obstacles to the peopling of the Americas. The
Isthmus of Panama must have presented quite a problem
to the pioneers who were to fill Amazonia and the
Andean Highlands and to reach Cape Horn. Today nobody
sets off blithely by foot through the jungle that
separates Costa Rica from Colombia. The beach is the
best pathway at low tide; but it is an intermittent one.
It is better to hope that the shifts of climate which were
involved with the glaciers made Panama a drier country
than it is today.</p>
<p>Of course it was not only early man and his prey
that used the routes from Siberia across Bering Strait
and through Alaska and Canada. The later migrants&mdash;ancestors
<span class="pb" id="Page_25">25</span>
of the Algonquins, the Athapascans, and
others&mdash;undoubtedly came in the same way.</p>
<h3>Problematical Roads to the New World</h3>
<p>Other routes from other lands may have brought other migrants.
These routes are not so fanciful as the paths from Atlantis
and Mu, but they have had few advocates. M.
R. Harrington has mentioned the possibility that Magdalenian
man of Glacial or Postglacial Europe may
have crossed from Europe to Canada by way of Iceland
and Greenland and various ice- and land-bridges
to father the Eskimo.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_18" href="#fn_2_18">[18]</a> Ellsworth Huntington adds to
the land-bridge over Bering Strait &ldquo;wind-bridges&rdquo;
across the middle Atlantic.<a class="fn" id="fr_2_19" href="#fn_2_19">[19]</a> Like Father de Acosta,
he believes that storms may have blown occasional vessels
to the New World. To suggest that unwilling mariners
from the Mediterranean may thus have made oneway
trips, he cites from Stansbury Hagar<a class="fn" id="fr_2_20" href="#fn_2_20">[20]</a> striking
resemblances between the zodiacs of Europeans and of
the Mayas, Aztecs, and even Peruvians. Whether this
matter of the zodiacs is fact or fancy, Huntington&rsquo;s unwilling
voyagers could not have come much earlier
than the birth of Christ. More fantastic were the claims
voiced some years ago that the men who left skulls of
Australoid or Melanesian type in the caves of South
America reached that continent by a southern route
across an Antarctic bridge of land and ice. Of much
more serious importance is the possibility that the long-voyaging
Polynesians, having negotiated the 5,000 or
6,000 miles that lay between their home on the edge of
Asia and the Marquesas or Easter Island, would have
tried occasionally to continue their eastward course. If
they had done so, they could scarcely have missed
South America. But this was in our own era, not in the
time of early man.</p>

<p>Today we have a few facts about
early man and many guesses. Not so long ago there
were a few reputable anthropologists who believed
that the New World was innocent of man before 1000
<span class="small">B.C.</span> Now most of them grant a foothold at least 10,000
years ago to an enterprising savage&mdash;called Folsom man&mdash;whose
taste for travel was as great as his talent for
making an exceptionally fine and original type of stone
spear point. Some say he came to the New World 25,000
years ago. A few daring students find traces of an
earlier Australoid human who may have seen the last
glaciers taking shape. Well informed opinion places
man&rsquo;s entrance into the New World between 10,000
and 25,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Of course we must not expect early dates to be precise.
Many of them must be intelligent guesses as we
go deeper and deeper into the past and reach the time
when the glaciers were waxing and waning. To gain a
perspective upon such toying with time&mdash;as well as
upon early man in the Americas&mdash;we must next consider
the story of early man in the Old World. Incidentally,
its contradictions and uncertainties&mdash;prefaced
by a few in New World prehistory&mdash;may help
you to look with a charitable as well as critical eye
upon certain theories about the peopling of the Americas
which may be suspect today yet respectable tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Conflicts and Confusions</h3>
<p>The authors are afraid that
it may be a little hard for you, dear reader, to shake
yourself out of the late Victorianism of your schoolbooks
and accept the idea that someone discovered
America at least 14,092 years before Columbus. It may
be still harder for you to believe that he was not that
noble yet very vague red man whom you and your
teachers called the American Indian. Certainly you will
be shocked to hear that two or three anthropologists
of note believe he had more than a touch of Negroid
or Australoid blood. Your horror will be no greater,
however, than that of a few of our archaeologists; such
notions give them what might be called Victorian
vapors. Some accept ideas like these; others keep an
open mind, for they remember that many a scientific
fact of today was sheer nonsense to earlier generations,
and vice versa.</p>
<p>As late as 1900, the prehistory of Mexico was accounted
for very neatly by three successive words, Toltec,
Chichimec, and Aztec. Now we know other words,
and we know that other peoples and other cultures&mdash;Olmec,
Zapotec, Mixtec, Totonac, Tarascan, Teotihuacan&mdash;also
<span class="pb" id="Page_30">30</span>
played an important part. We divided the
Maya just as neatly into the Old Empire and the New,
one south and the other north. Now we know that
there were no empires, and that the Maya culture grew
widely and steadily towards fruition and decay. Once
we thought that the Itz&aacute; were the Maya that founded
Chich&eacute;n-Itz&aacute; in Yucatan. Now we give the name Itz&aacute;
to the Toltec or Toltec-influenced invaders that came
hundreds of years later. Once scientists disputed
whether culture and agriculture began in the highlands
of Mexico or in the highlands of Peru. Now certain of
them believe that the American became a farmer in
the lowlands east of the Andes, while others think he
began to till the soil in many spots at the same time.
Only a few years ago, we thought that a fairly recent
Indian culture&mdash;which is called the Woodland Pattern
of the eastern United States&mdash;had its roots in Middle
America. Now its pottery is being traced back through
northwestern Canada and northern Asia to the Baltic
and even perhaps to Africa.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_1" href="#fn_3_1">[1]</a> The Mound Builders
were once thought an ancient people. Now some
of them seem barely to antedate the discovery of
America. Bernal D&iacute;az del Castillo&mdash;best of the chroniclers
of the conquest of Mexico&mdash;may have observed
that the Mexicans, along with all the Indians of the
New World, were ignorant of the principle of the
wheel; certainly this has been repeated over and over
again for many years. Yet in 1888 D&eacute;sir&eacute; Charnay
reported and pictured a Mexican pottery toy with
wheels, and since then more of these toys have been
found.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_2" href="#fn_3_2">[2]</a> Throughout his life Roland B. Dixon denied
the possibility of productive transpacific migration
from Polynesia to South America; yet at the end he accepted
the transfer of the sweet potato from South
America to Polynesia. From important matters to trivia,
the list is long; we have hardly touched it. Obviously,
prehistory is not a field where truth is easily and
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
quickly come upon. The student, quite as much as the
scientist, must keep an open mind. He must neither
cherish dogma nor refuse speculation. Truth still lies
afar off.</p>
<p>Doubts about early man in the Americas seem to
have been an occupational disease with archaeologists.
Geologists have found it much easier to accept him.
Men like Ernst Antevs, M. M. Leighton, Kirk Bryan,
and Albrecht Penck, perhaps because they are accustomed
to dealing generously with time, seem to have
little trouble in embracing early man as a Late Glacial
interloper anywhere from 15,000 to 100,000 years ago.
Physical anthropologists like Earnest A. Hooton and
Sir Arthur Keith, and cultural anthropologists and
ethnologists like Roland Dixon and A. C. Haddon are
not at all afraid to recognize signs of Australoid or Negroid
ancestry in the skulls of New World man. Perhaps
it is easier for the geologists and the physical anthropologists
to accept such ideas because they do not
run counter to their own dogmas. Many archaeologists,
at any rate, find it extraordinarily hard to adjust themselves
to evidence which does not fit accepted theories.
They may defend themselves by pointing out that the
evidence is not too clear, or at best is merely suggestive;
but the theories they cherish arose from no firmer evidence
in many cases, and frequently continue quite as
unclear or at best merely suggestive. Certainly such reluctance
to accept new evidence held back archaeological
research when Ale&#353; Hrdli&#269;ka, W. H. Holmes,
and Daniel G. Brinton were in their heyday.</p>
<p>This reluctance to face facts permeated even so
great and productive a man as Baron Erland Nordenski&ouml;ld.
An example of such a Jovian nod may be salutary.
Arguing in <i>The Copper and Bronze Ages in South
America</i> against the theory that the craft of metallurgy
may have been brought to the New World by migrants,
instead of having been invented here, three times he
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
cites facts that contradict his thesis, and three times he
offers a kind of self-conscious apology for blinking
them. (The italics are ours.)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If we go through all our material of weapons and
tools of bronze and copper from South America, <i>we
must confess</i> that there is not much that is entirely
original, and that to the majority of fundamental types
there is something to correspond in the Old World.</p>
<p class="tb"><i>It must be confessed</i> that there is considerable similarity
between the metal technique of the New World
and that of the Old during the Bronze Age.</p>
<p class="tb">Bronze is, of course, also a very hard invention, and
<i>I must confess</i> to finding it most remarkable that the
art of alloying tin and copper should have been hit
upon independently both in the Old World and the
New.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_3" href="#fn_3_3">[3]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Admissions,&rdquo; said Charles John Darling, &ldquo;are mostly
made by those who do not know their importance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Unfortunately there are still a few archaeologists
whose attitude resembles Nordenski&ouml;ld&rsquo;s. Hooton
writes of one of these:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of our most brilliant and once progressive archaeologists
na&iuml;vely expressed to me some years ago
his sentiments on this question [evidences of early man
in America]. He said it would be a pity to have new
evidence come to light which would overthrow all the
admirable scientific work of the past indicating the
recent arrival in the New World of the American
Indian.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_4" href="#fn_3_4">[4]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Of course early man is not a subject that can hope
to be free from error and contradiction&mdash;even early
man in the Old World. Perhaps an account of some of
the errors and misconceptions about him that crept into
the study of prehistory may be as good a means as any
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
of preparing your mind for new facts or new heresies
in the Americas.</p>
<h3>The Problem of the Ages</h3>
<p>The first confusion that confronts
the student of early man is one of nomenclature.
It is a by-product of the human animal&rsquo;s inveterate and
estimable love of system. Give us some new subject,
such as prehistoric relics, and we immediately set up a
scheme of classification. The scheme works beautifully
for a while, but presently new evidence accumulates
which doesn&rsquo;t fit the framework. By that time, unfortunately,
it is too late to change the classification. In
vulgar parlance, it is our story, and we are stuck with
it.</p>
<p>An outstanding example of this tendency to set up
a classification system prematurely is the division of
the story of man into ages. As far back as <span class="small">A.D.</span> 52 a
Chinese with a scientific bent of mind suggested that
man had passed through three periods: a stone age,
a bronze age, and an iron age. A French magistrate
named Goguet wrote a book in 1758 in which he expounded
a similar order of ages, inserting copper
ahead of bronze. In 1813 a Dutch historian named
Vedel-Simonsen argued for stone, bronze, and iron periods
in Scandinavian history. A Dane, Christian Jurgensen
Thomsen, gave the system permanent and indeed
international status in 1836 when he arranged on
this basis the exhibits of the institution he directed, the
National Museum in Copenhagen.</p>
<p>The scheme is neat but far from scientific. To begin
with a small matter, but one that may confuse the layman,
the ages overlap. Bronze did not wholly replace
stone; neither did iron. The use of chipped flint and
polished stone continued into the Iron Age.</p>
<h3>The Bronze Age&mdash;a Phantasm</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Bronze Age&rdquo; itself is a
misnomer and a phantasm. While &ldquo;Stone Age&rdquo; and
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
&ldquo;Iron Age&rdquo; do define important culture periods&mdash;though
not the only periods of man&rsquo;s early activity&mdash;the
Bronze Age, says T. A. Rickard, &ldquo;represents a minor
phase in the use of copper.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_5" href="#fn_3_5">[5]</a> This alloy is merely an
incident in the much longer history of the first metal
used by man. At the start copper seemed to him to be
merely a soft stone. He beat it into ornaments. When
he began to melt and cast the native metal instead of
pounding it, he took the first step in the true use of
metals; but when he smelted copper ore&mdash;turning a
hard rock into a soft metal&mdash;he made himself the master
of metallurgy. Bronze&mdash;at first an accidental mixing
of copper and tin&mdash;was merely an episode along the
way. &ldquo;The superiority of copper or bronze over flint
and stone tools is, I think,&rdquo; says Gordon Childe, &ldquo;generally
overestimated. Not only for tilling the land but
also for the execution of monumental carvings and even
for shaving, the Egyptians of the Old Kingdom were
apparently content with stone.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_6" href="#fn_3_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>The Bronze Age was very limited in area. Because
of the rarity of tin, the primitive use of the alloy was
confined to southern Europe, Asia Minor, and the Inca
empire. Most of the world used iron before bronze. Furthermore,
the Bronze Age is as delimited in time as it is
in space. The earliest bronze in the Danube region is
dated about 2300 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and the earliest iron about 1350
<span class="small">B.C.</span>, at Gerar in Judea. &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; said Rickard, &ldquo;the so-called
Bronze Age shrinks, at most, to a mere millennium
... the merest fraction of human existence.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_7" href="#fn_3_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Iron Age is not so significant as it sounds. It was
many centuries after the first use of iron and bronze
that either played a really important part in the economic
life of man. Like the domesticated horse, the
trained elephant, and the wheeled vehicle, bronze and
iron were first used chiefly in the making of war.</p>
<h3>Wood, Bone, and Shell Ages</h3>
<p>There is another serious
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
weakness in the Stone Age, Bronze Age, Iron Age sequence.
It takes no account of the probability that man
used wood, bone, and shell before he used stone. The
ape swings a stick much as the first man must have
done. The carcass of some bison or stag, picked clean
by vultures, must have seemed to our earliest ancestors
&ldquo;a whole potential tool-shop&rdquo;&mdash;as George R. Stewart
writes in <i>Man: An Autobiography</i>&mdash;&ldquo;thigh bones
ready-made for clubs, horns or antlers for awls, shoulder-blades
for scrapers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_8" href="#fn_3_8">[8]</a> As early as 1864, a British
student of anthropology, John Crawfurd, stood out
against Thomsen&rsquo;s Stone Age as the beginning of culture.
At a meeting of the Ethnological Society, he said:
&ldquo;On man&rsquo;s first appearance, the most obvious materials
would consist of wood and bone.... This would constitute
the wood and bone age, of which, from the perishable
nature of the materials, we, of course, possess
but slender records.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_9" href="#fn_3_9">[9]</a> Because the discovery of the
stone artifacts of early man in Europe was then creating
a scientific furore, Crawfurd&rsquo;s sane observations
went unnoticed. Today we have part of a wooden
spear made, perhaps, far back in the Great Ice Age
(see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_74">page 74</a>).</p>
<p>Wood, bone, and shell not only antedated stone;
they have continued in use until today. Certain primitive
peoples&mdash;the Chukchi of Siberia, for example&mdash;retained
the use of wood and bone after they were given
iron.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_10" href="#fn_3_10">[10]</a> Numerous tribes, when first encountered by explorers
and navigators, had not yet begun to use stone;
among these were the Aleuts, the Andaman Islanders,
Malayans from the hills, and people of the upper
Amazon.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_11" href="#fn_3_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>Rickard, from whom we have drawn liberally in this
discussion, proposes a different scheme of classification
for the cultures of man.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_12" href="#fn_3_12">[12]</a> In the Primordial Age he
would include the primary use of wood, bone, and
shell. He would accept the Stone Age as the next stage.
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
For the Bronze and Iron ages he would substitute the
Metallurgic Age, basing this on the discovery and use
of smelting, whatever the metal involved. The dead
hand of Thomsen, however, will probably continue to
rule. The best we can do will be to take the Stone Age
as including all materials except metal, and pay little
attention to that illusion the Bronze Age.</p>
<h3>Dividing the Stone Age&mdash;the Old and the New</h3>
<p>Still
more conflict and confusion have resulted from attempts
to divide the Stone Age into watertight compartments.
In 1865 Sir John Lubbock proposed two
divisions&mdash;the Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age&mdash;and the
Neolithic, or New Stone Age.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_13" href="#fn_3_13">[13]</a> The Paleolithic included
objects found in caves and glacial gravels; the
Neolithic, on the surface and in tombs. The first period
ran from some vague beginning hundreds of thousands
of years ago up to the advent of the Neolithic after the
glaciers had melted. By definition, paleolithic man
made chipped stone implements and no other kind.
Neolithic man was supposed to be distinguished by the
making of ground, or&mdash;as we usually say&mdash;polished,
stone axes and of other tools shaped by rubbing instead
of chipping; agriculture, pottery, and textiles came in
as secondary traits.</p>
<p>After a time, however, archaeologists found some
disturbing discrepancies. Before neolithic man grew
grain and wove textiles, someone of an earlier age
seems to have been making axes from antlers, turning
out new artifacts called microliths&mdash;tiny chips of flint
which were set in a row along a wooden or bone handle
to make a kind of saw or a sickle&mdash;and also producing
a partially polished ax with a ground edge, and making
crude pots. This was all very upsetting to the old
scheme of dividing prehistory into the Paleolithic and
the Neolithic. So science inserted the Mesolithic, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
Middle Stone Age, between the two, in order to account
for the appearance of the new tools.</p>
<p>The trouble with the system that Lubbock launched
is that man&rsquo;s behavior toward stone is a very poor basis
for classifying him in culture or time. For a while it
fitted our knowledge of the prehistory of Europe. Now
it is out of line on that continent, and completely
askew so far as the rest of the world is concerned. The
kind of stone available often determines whether a
man will chip or grind it. When first discovered, South
Sea Islanders were still polishing stone because they
had no flint.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_14" href="#fn_3_14">[14]</a> Some Australian natives make chipped
stone tools while their neighbors, who control a supply
of diorite, go in for polishing; yet none of these Blackfellows
can be considered as anything but paleolithic.</p>
<p>Like the Bronze Age, the Neolithic suffers from having
shrunk in length. Rickard figures &ldquo;that 700 years
covers what was meant to be a major division of human
chronology.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_15" href="#fn_3_15">[15]</a> To reach this figure he puts the end of
the Paleolithic at 3000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, which seems much too late,
and the beginning of bronze at 2300. Even though we
use the date of N. C. Nelson for the beginning of the
Neolithic&mdash;5500 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_3_16" href="#fn_3_16">[16]</a>&mdash;we have a New Stone Age of
only 3,200 years.</p>
<p>Gordon Childe goes so far as to declare that &ldquo;there
is no such thing as a neolithic civilization.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_17" href="#fn_3_17">[17]</a> Different
people, living under different climates and on different
soils, have developed different elements of the culture
of the New Stone Age and combined them with elements
of other cultures.</p>
<p>If we are going to continue using the term Neolithic&mdash;as
we certainly are&mdash;and if we want to limit it in some
sensible way that may prove a bit more permanent, let
us see what else than polished stone can be used to
define it.</p>
<h3>Activities of the New Stone Age</h3>
<p>Three activities
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
stand out. They are the making of pots, the weaving of
textiles, and the planting and harvesting of crops accompanied
by the domestication of animals.</p>
<p>There can be no question that pottery is an important
factor in neolithic life. It was in the New Stone
Age that man fully wrought the miracle of &ldquo;a sort of
magic transubstantiation&mdash;the conversion of mud or
dust into stone,&rdquo; as Childe puts it. It was, as he says,
&ldquo;the earliest conscious utilization by man of a chemical
change.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_3_18" href="#fn_3_18">[18]</a> But behind this miracle and this science
must have lain many years of almost accidental, adventitious
experiment. L. S. B. Leakey claims specimens
of partially baked pottery sherds in paleolithic
Africa.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_19" href="#fn_3_19">[19]</a> One of these shows marks of basketry, rather
thin support for the theory that the women who
daubed the inside of the baskets to make them hold
water must have discovered, when the baskets stood
too near the fire, a little bit about how to bake clay. It
was not until the invention of agriculture tied neolithic
man more or less to the soil that true pottery could and
did flourish widely. We have added many refinements
to the craft of the potter&mdash;porcelain, cloisonn&eacute;, and so
forth&mdash;but basically it remains unchanged. Incidentally,
all agriculturists did not have pottery&mdash;the Big
Bend and Hueco cave dwellers of Texas, and certain
people of the Vir&uacute; valley in Peru, for example.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_20" href="#fn_3_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The craft of textile weaving almost reached perfection
at the hands of neolithic man&mdash;or, rather, woman.
But it stemmed from basketry, and basketry undoubtedly
began in the Paleolithic Age.</p>
<p>The first of two interesting facts suggested by the
foregoing is that woman was the only true begetter of
the Neolithic Age. She did the weaving&mdash;first of baskets
and then of textiles&mdash;and she invented and practiced
pottery making. More than that, she must be credited
with the planting and harvesting of grain; for, while
her lord and master enjoyed himself on the hunt, she
<span class="pb" id="Page_39">39</span>
gathered fruits, nuts, and edible seeds, and sooner or
later this led her to observe that seeds she carelessly
dropped on the midden pile produced new and bigger
plants. By so doing woman invented work; for early
man was only an idler who gave himself intermittently
to the pleasures of the chase. Woman also invented
leisure&mdash;true, creative leisure&mdash;for out of agriculture
rose a settled community and a surplus of provender
which allowed the few to think and plan and build
civilization.</p>
<h3>Agriculture&mdash;Test of the Neolithic</h3>
<p>The second fact is
that agriculture seems to be the only sound test of the
Neolithic. Pottery and weaving preceded agriculture,
yet, without agriculture and its fixed communities and
its leisure, pottery and weaving could not have reached
perfection. As for the polished ax, it was handy enough
in in-fighting; but it was of no practical social use until
the farmer needed to cut down the trees which began
to thrive all over the place when the glaciers disappeared.
The Badarians of Egypt were farmers, yet they
made no polished axes because there was almost no
timber to cut.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_21" href="#fn_3_21">[21]</a></p>
<p>Speech was certainly the first great inventive triumph
of primitive man. The making of fire ranks second.
The third great invention, agriculture, was also
the first industrial revolution; without it what we carelessly
assume to be <i>the</i> industrial revolution would
have been impossible.</p>
<p>Science feels sure that agriculture appeared in the
Old World before it did in the New, but is not so certain
as to where man first tilled the soil and when.
James H. Breasted, Sr., put agriculture back to 18,000
<span class="small">B.C.</span>; later writers push it up to 5000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> There has
been quite as much disagreement about the area
where agriculture began. At first the valley of the Nile
seemed to be the right spot, for every fall the flood
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
waters of the river brought not only automatic irrigation
but also fresh, fertile soil to enrich the depleted
farm lands. Soon, however, the birthplace of agriculture
moved to the &ldquo;fertile crescent&rdquo; that stretched from
Egypt to Mesopotamia. Later it shifted from the Tigris-Euphrates
valley to the valley of the Indus. Now it
seems to lie somewhere between these two, perhaps
in the dry highlands of Iran and Iraq. In northern Iraq,
400 miles north of Ur, the wild ancestors of certain of
our cultivated grains still grow, and excavators have
come on evidences of farming communities which may
be 8,000 to 11,000 years old.<a class="fn" id="fr_3_22" href="#fn_3_22">[22]</a> There has always been
hot argument between the supporters of denuded
river valleys and the supporters of dry uplands as the
natural site of early agriculture. Lately students have
begun to argue for forested or jungle areas, and above
all for mountain valleys; and they have plumped for
tubers and melons, rather than grains, as the first crops
cultivated by early man. These students see man as a
gardener before he was a farmer.</p>
<p>Only the beginnings of agriculture are of any importance
in a discussion of early man. Early man may invent
agriculture, but thereupon he promptly ceases to
be early man. With the food, leisure, and fixed abode
that farming provides, he is soon inventing writing. He
is then no longer even prehistoric.</p>
<h3>First a Food Gatherer, Then a Hunter</h3>
<p>It is important
to realize and remember that early man ate seed
grains, tubers, and fruit before he knew how to cultivate
them. Probably he began to eat more and more
of these natural products just before he became a
farmer. Because archaeologists have found evidences
that early man was quite a food gatherer at the end of
his career, they have been inclined to set up another
classification system which is faulty. They see man first
as a hunter, then as a food gatherer who was still a
<span class="pb" id="Page_41">41</span>
hunter, and then as a food producer. This ignores the
very important fact that man began as a food gatherer
and not as a hunter.</p>
<p>The first man probably ate the same food as the great
ape&mdash;fruits, nuts, roots, and berries&mdash;and perhaps grubs
and insects. Occasionally he may have varied his repast
with birds&rsquo; eggs and fledglings. With a broken
branch for a weapon, he improved his diet a bit. He
knocked over small animals, and he may occasionally
have got hold of the carcass of a large one, but, for
thousands upon thousands of years, he was basically a
vegetarian. His first well developed stone tool&mdash;the
hand ax shaped rather like a flattened and pointed egg&mdash;was
probably more useful for grubbing roots and tubers
out of the ground than for killing animals. As early
man learned to make more efficient weapons&mdash;first the
curved throwing stick, then the spear and the spear-thrower,
and finally the bow and arrow&mdash;hunting became
his chief activity, and meat his chief diet. But his
woman went right on gathering berries and nuts, tubers
and seeds, and getting ready to invent agriculture.
Certainly in the New World&mdash;perhaps in the Old
World, too&mdash;she invented milling stones to grind seeds
while her man was still a paleolithic. Perhaps when she
watched the wearing away and the smoothing down
of mortar and pestle, milling stone and mano, as she
ground her seeds into flour between them, the idea
may have occurred to her&mdash;or to her man who watched
her labor&mdash;that it was possible to grind and polish stone
into axes and other implements.</p>
<p>We feel that the life-story of prehistoric man can
best be divided&mdash;certainly for the purposes of this
book&mdash;into a Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, which included
the making of artifacts out of wood, bone, shell,
and chipped and sometimes polished stone, and a
Neolithic, or New Stone Age, which was defined by
the invention of agriculture and the perfecting of pottery,
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
of weaving, and of the polishing of stone. This
may reduce a little the confusions that are inevitable
in the study of early man tens of thousands to hundreds
of thousands of years ago. Conflicts of evidence
and opinion will remain, of course. We need not let
them deter us from judging early man in the Americas.
Indeed, they should free us from paying too much
heed to the dogmas of scientific conservatism.</p>

</blockquote>
<h3>Our Part of the Geologic Time Scale</h3>
<p>The dead hand
of another system of classification lies across a still
larger area than the Stone Age itself or the Age of Man.
This area is the entire life of our earth since it took
sufficient shape to support cellular life. As it is so large
an area and much of it is so remote in time, changes
in the definition of most of its various divisions do not
much affect the present discussion.</p>
<p>Once upon a time there were four great divisions,
neatly numbered in Latin as the Primary, the Secondary,
the Tertiary, and the Quaternary. The first two
went by the board when newer scientists found older
ages and stretched the life of the earth a couple of billion
years. The Tertiary is still a respected appellation,
but the good name of the Quaternary&mdash;the area of time
with which this book is mainly concerned&mdash;is seriously
questioned. Defined as the Age of Man, it was supposed
to harbor all evidence of his existence; but hints
of his presence in the Tertiary have rather sullied the
scientific standing of the later period.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>In this book we are concerned with two divisions of
the Quaternary which are also growing vaguer in outline,
less precise in time. They are the Pleistocene, or
Glacial Period, or Great Ice Age, and the Holocene,
Recent, or Postglacial Period in which we now live.
(If your Greek is rusty, you will be amused to discover
that those scientific-sounding terms are merely
translations of &ldquo;wholly recent&rdquo; and &ldquo;most recent.&rdquo;)
Most geologists believe that these two areas of time
covered about 1,000,000 years; but some give them
half a million more, and a few limit them to the 600,000
years, or even 300,000 years, of the last four glaciations.
Some start the Postglacial 25,000 years ago, when
the ice began to shrink toward its present limits; some
start it 9,000 years ago, when a relatively modern climate
appeared. Some geologists say we are still in the
Pleistocene, and merely enjoying a warm spell before
another glaciation.</p>
<p>By definition&mdash;or lack of it&mdash;the Pleistocene is rather
vaguely bounded, and quite as much at its beginning
as at its end. To the paleontologist, the Pleistocene is
the time of certain large and picturesque mammals
that are now extinct. To the geologist, it is the time of
the waxing and waning of the great glaciers. The beginnings
and the ends of these two definitions of the
Pleistocene do not correspond too closely. We shall use
the term as little as possible, substituting the Great Ice
Age.</p>
<h3>The Glacial Hypothesis Appears</h3>
<p>It is hardly more
than a century since science began to realize that large
<span class="pb" id="Page_46">46</span>
parts of Europe and North America once were covered
with glaciers. The discovery came from attempts to explain
certain disturbing things called &ldquo;erratic blocks.&rdquo;
These were large masses of stone&mdash;sometimes weighing
as much as 10,000 tons&mdash;which had no business being
where they were, because the native rock in their
neighborhood was entirely different. Some of the erratic
blocks, for example, should have been hundreds
of miles away. The common explanation was that they
were water-borne, perhaps by the biblical flood. An
American cotton manufacturer accounted for the wearing
away and the scratching of such boulders by supposing
that they had been embedded in the lower surfaces
of icebergs and then swept scraping across the
earth by the tumultuous waters on which the Ark had
ridden. In 1802 John Playfair, a professor of mathematics
at Edinburgh, ventured the theory that the
blocks had been transported by glacial ice.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_1" href="#fn_4_1">[1]</a> This idea
had occurred to a mountaineer named Kuhn in 1787,
and Saussure echoed it in 1803; they knew and interpreted
correctly the moraines of loose stones and
boulders which they saw at the foot and the sides of the
glaciers. From 1821 to the middle thirties various
French, Swiss, and German scientists&mdash;Brard, Venetz,
Charpentier, and Schimper&mdash;discussed and amplified
this idea. Though A. Bernhardi, an obscure German
professor of forestry, suggested in 1832 that &ldquo;the polar
ice once reached clear to the southernmost edge of the
district which is now covered by those rock remnants,&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_2" href="#fn_4_2">[2]</a>
it was not until 1837 that the glacial theory took definite
shape. Then Louis Agassiz, speaking before a
Swiss society, launched the glacial hypothesis that
there had been a period of great cold just before the
advent of recent life. By 1840, when Agassiz published
his <i>Studies of the Glaciers</i>, the idea was pretty
generally accepted; he had &ldquo;added the Glacial Epoch
<span class="pb" id="Page_47">47</span>
to the geological time-table.&rdquo; The theory has been
much amplified since then.</p>
<p>Adolphe Morlot, in 1854, discovered fossils of temperate
plants between layers of glacial deposits, and
advanced the theory that there had been warm periods
as well as cold ones during the Great Ice Age. In his
&ldquo;Notice sur le Quaternaire en Suisse&rdquo; he suggested
three separate glaciations with two warm interglacial
periods between. In 1874 James Geikie, the geologist
of Edinburgh, brought out his <i>The Great Ice Age and
Its Relation to the Antiquity of Man</i>, building upon
Morlot&rsquo;s work; and his <i>Prehistoric Europe</i>, in 1881, expanded
the glaciations to six. Yet for thirty more years
some stubborn scientists still believed in a single
glaciation.</p>
<p>It was not until the turn of the century that the work
of Albrecht Penck and Eduard Br&uuml;ckner established
the history of the Alpine glaciations on a solid scientific
foundation that has endured pretty well till today.
They found four major glaciations and named them in
neat alphabetical order after four Alpine valleys&mdash;G&uuml;nz,
Mindel, Riss, and W&uuml;rm.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_3" href="#fn_4_3">[3]</a> They divided the
W&uuml;rm glaciation at first into two periods of activity,
and later into a number of smaller oscillations toward
the end. There has been some controversy over the
subdivisions of the W&uuml;rm, and one to three Danubian
glaciers have been suggested hundreds of thousands
of years before the G&uuml;nz; but the general hypothesis
brought forward by Agassiz and the amplifications of
his successors are now definitely established. With all
this goes much knowledge of the ice sheets that covered
Scandinavia, northern England, and Germany as
far south as Dresden, and North America from ocean
to ocean and down to Long Island and the Ohio and
Missouri rivers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<h3>The End of the Great Ice Age</h3>
<p>Authorities agree that
the last melting of the ice sheets and glaciers in the
Alpine region began somewhere between 20,000 and
15,500 years ago. After considerable shrinkage and oscillation,
the ice increased again for about 5,000 years,
and then began to shrink once more. There is some
disagreement as to when the Great Ice Age ended; a
recent and very minor Daun glaciation has been rather
rashly dated as late as only 3,500 years ago. These calculations
are only for the Alpine region, and we must
remember, of course, that the great ice sheets of northern
Europe and North America behaved somewhat
differently.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig11">
<img src="images/i007.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="388" />
<p class="caption">THE ICE FIELDS OF THE LAST GLACIATION</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>At the height of the last glaciation 5,000,000 square
miles of North America were covered with ice, as against
2,500,000 in Eurasia. The volume of ice was three times
as great. The shore lines are those of the present rather
than glacial time. (Map after Flint, 1957; Antevs, 1928;
and Flint and Dorsey, 1945; estimates from Daly, 1934.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>We have some fairly exact knowledge about the retreat
of the ice across Sweden. This has resulted from
the theory of Baron Gerhard de Geer that the varves&mdash;layers
<span class="pb" id="Page_49">49</span>
of alternately coarse and fine clays deposited
in lakes in front of the retreating glaciers&mdash;represent
the summer and winter sediments released by the melting
ice. (We have a somewhat similar index in the
tree-ring count of wide and narrow rings originated by
A. E. Douglass and improved upon by Harold S. Gladwin.
Both tree rings and varves may reflect changes
in solar radiation.) De Geer counted the varves and
determined that the ice sheet began to retreat in
southernmost Sweden some 14,000 years ago, and Ragnar
Liden determined that it had disappeared by
6840 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<p>De Geer&rsquo;s Swedish-American pupil Ernst Antevs
applied the same system in North America, and found
the ice beginning to retreat from Long Island 36,500
years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_4" href="#fn_4_4">[4]</a> A calculation of the time required for the
wearing away of the postglacial Niagara Gorge has produced
about the same result, but this has been seriously
challenged by Richard F. Flint.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_5" href="#fn_4_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>The picture of glaciation is more complicated in
North America than in the Old World. Europe had two
main areas of ice&mdash;a small one in the Alps, a much
larger one in Scandinavia, the British Isles, northern
Germany, and Poland&mdash;but they were self-contained.
North America had three ice centers&mdash;the Labradoran
east of Hudson Bay, the Keewatin west of the bay, and
the Cordilleran in the Canadian Rockies; these three
sheets of ice did not always grow or shrink at the same
time or at the same rate, and they occasionally overlapped
(see maps on pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_26">26</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_27">27</a>).</p>
<p>Incidentally, most of the ice of the glacial period was
in the New World. The area of land covered was almost
twice as great as in the Old World, and the bulk of ice
three to five times as great.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_6" href="#fn_4_6">[6]</a></p>
<h3>River Terraces and Beach Lines</h3>
<p>There are other evidences
of glaciation besides varves, erratic blocks,
<span class="pb" id="Page_50">50</span>
moraines of stones and mixed debris along the sides
and fronts of the ice streams, and scratches and polish
on the native rock over which the glaciers passed. Four
raised terraces are found along the sides of many river
valleys. Four raised beach lines, first found in the
Mediterranean region, have now been noted in the
Americas and Australia. Submerged beach lines and
land-bridges have been found at certain places under
the ocean, as well as deep channels prolonging present
rivers far out to sea.</p>
<p>Naturally enough the Great Ice Age was a time of
notable changes of climate. Vegetation advanced and
retreated widely. The level of the sea rose and fell
some hundreds of feet. Whether or not there was more
rain and snow&mdash;a moot point with science&mdash;the many
rivers of the world grew in volume, and often in speed,
at certain times and became low and sluggish at others.
These profound alternations created the river terraces
which have aided so much in determining the age of
man and his various cultures. As the ocean sank, while
the glaciers grew, the slopes of river beds became
steeper, and the rivers themselves grew swifter. The
turbulent rivers cut deeper channels and carried the
displaced materials far down their valleys and ultimately
even into the sea. During the cold, dry period
at the climax of each glaciation, the dying trees and
brush and grasses released their grip on gravels and
silts, the intermittent flood waters of the melting glaciers
carried away the debris and&mdash;because the rivers
lost in slope and grew sluggish as the sea level rose&mdash;they
deposited the gravels and silts in their beds. As
the glaciers grew again and the oceans sank, the rivers
once more became swifter and more turbulent, cut
deeper channels, carried away part of the gravels and
silts, and left the rest as terraces. Thus the passing of
each glaciation meant the adding of a new and a lower
terrace to the river valleys. Four such sets of river terraces
are found just outside the areas where the glaciers
have been active&mdash;in the valleys of the Rhine, the
Thames, the Somme, the Isar, and other rivers.</p>

<p class="caption">THE AGE OF RIVER TERRACES</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>These simplified sections of a river valley show how successive
channels were cut deeper and deeper, leaving the
older deposits of gravels and silts in the higher terraces at
the sides. The discovery of this process of nature was of
the greatest value in determining the age and the succession
of the cultures of early man in Europe. The oldest
flint tools were found in the gravels of the highest terraces,
and the newest in the lowest.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>Farther to the south, periods of great rainfall helped
to produce similar river terraces in valleys like the Nile.
The concentration of masses of ice in central and northern
Europe upset the zones of climate of Africa and
other parts of the earth and caused great climatic disturbance.
Rainfall belts moved far south, and the rain
increased in abundance. Such periods of rain are
called pluvials. There is still a good deal of argument
about whether pluvial periods occurred principally in
glacial or interglacial periods. This affects the dating
of early man, and it is particularly important to us in
the New World.</p>
<p>The raised beaches and the submerged beaches
were obviously caused primarily by the lowering and
raising of the sea level and not of the land. There were
land movements, of course&mdash;as there are even now&mdash;but
they were either too small or too irregular to account
entirely for the systematic arrangement of old
beaches in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>There has been much controversy about other glacial
matters, but there can be no question that the submerged
beaches and the land-bridges were a by-product
of glaciation. The great masses of ice&mdash;estimated
to have averaged half a mile to two miles thick
in North America and somewhere between those figures
in northern Europe&mdash;depressed somewhat the
parts of the earth on which they lay; the rest of the
land tended consequently to rise a bit, though not
enough to account for the now sunken beaches and for
the land-bridges that united Africa and Europe, England
and the Continent, and Alaska and Siberia at
various times. It was the immense amount of sea water
drawn up and locked in the glaciers that reduced
the area of the ocean and created new shore lines and
<span class="pb" id="Page_53">53</span>
the land-bridges. Estimates of how much the seas were
lowered from their present level range from 70 to 1,800
feet; the best are 200 to 300 feet. There is still enough
glacial ice to raise the ocean more than 100 feet if it
all melted.</p>
<p>The raised beaches belong to a later discussion of
the cause of the Great Ice Age as a whole.</p>
<h3>The Cause of Glaciation</h3>
<p>Most geologists believe that
a comparatively slight drop in temperature would
bring back the glaciers and the ice fields. The German
geologist Br&uuml;ckner calculated that summers in the last
glaciation were only 4&deg; centigrade, or about 7&deg; Fahrenheit,
colder than they are today.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_7" href="#fn_4_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>What could have caused this slight drop in temperature
in the Great Ice Age? Most of the explanations are
not satisfactory. One is that the earth happened to pass
through a dust laden nebula that reduced solar radiation.
Another is a hypothetical decrease in the amount
of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Other explanations
have to do with changes in the altitude of land,
shifts in air currents and ocean currents, volcanic eruptions
filling the air with dust that screened the rays of
the sun. All these adventitious causes would have had
to be repeated with the curious and complex rhythm
which is characteristic of the waxing and waning of the
ice sheets.</p>
<p>One theory seems to have a good deal of cogency.
It depends on three known alterations in the relation
of the earth to the sun. The first is a slow, regular
change in the shape of the earth&rsquo;s orbit through a cycle
of 92,000 years. The second is a shift in the inclination
of the earth&rsquo;s axis through 40,000 years. The third is
what a layman would call the wobble of this axis
through 21,000 years. The first change increases or decreases
the distance of the earth from the sun. The
other two alter the angle of the sun&rsquo;s rays and thus also
<span class="pb" id="Page_54">54</span>
increase or decrease the warmth given a particular
area of the earth at certain seasons. No single unfavorable
position would have had a great deal of effect in
lowering summer temperature in the northern hemisphere,
but two occurring at the same time&mdash;let alone
three&mdash;would have appreciably diminished the sun&rsquo;s
heat.</p>
<p>This astronomical theory of the cause of glaciation
goes back a hundred years. As long ago as 1842 the
French mathematician and astronomer J. Adh&eacute;mar
suggested that changes in the earth&rsquo;s axis increased
rainfall and provided the floods which he thought had
moved the erratic blocks. Between 1864 and 1875
James Croll combined the wobble of the earth&rsquo;s axis
and the change in the earth&rsquo;s orbit. A number of other
men worked unsatisfactorily on the problem. The Serbian
astronomer and physicist Milutin Milankovitch
combined all three, and, between his first publication
in 1913 and his latest in 1938, calculated the variations
of solar radiation for the past 650,000 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_8" href="#fn_4_8">[8]</a> In 1924
W. K&ouml;ppen and A. Wegener applied Milankovitch&rsquo;s
early figures to the glaciation question, and Frederick
E. Zeuner has lately used the revised figures of Milankovitch.
Zeuner&rsquo;s results, somewhat simplified, appear
on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_55">page 55</a>. They are fairly close to the geological estimates
of B. Eberl and W. Soergel; his last two glaciations
extend further back than those of Penck and
Br&uuml;ckner.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_9" href="#fn_4_9">[9]</a> Zeuner&rsquo;s dates do not agree, of course, with
those of an extremist like the geologist Kirtley F.
Mather, who dates the first, or G&uuml;nz, glaciation as
ranging from 2,000,000 to 1,500,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_10" href="#fn_4_10">[10]</a> Zeuner&rsquo;s
findings work out well enough for the American
glaciations, except that there is no New World equivalent
for his first W&uuml;rm maximum of 115,000 years ago.
Many authorities refuse to accept any such condition
in the Old World. Because of this glaciation Zeuner
moves back the appearance of <i>Homo sapiens</i> a good
50,000 or even 75,000 years.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>

<p class="caption">THE FOUR GREAT GLACIATIONS</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Six varying estimates of their duration made by five authorities.
Fisk&rsquo;s are of the New World glaciers, which are
generally equated with those of Europe.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>There is one serious objection to Zeuner&rsquo;s theory.
Two of the three movements of the earth on which it
is based would have reduced the warmth of summer
in the northern hemisphere, but they would at the
same time have increased the temperature of the southern
hemisphere, thus alternating glaciation in the two
hemispheres. Unfortunately, it is fairly well established
that glaciers north and south of the equator have
waxed and waned at the same time over a considerable
number of years.</p>
<p>It is not enough, of course, to find the cause of the
individual glaciations. There must be a cause for the
glacial period as a whole. The Great Ice Age was an
almost unique event in the history of the earth. We
have to go back 200,000,000 years, to the time of the
reptiles that preceded the dinosaurs, before we come
again on major glaciations.</p>
<p>Zeuner states frankly that the astronomic theory
&ldquo;does not provide the cause of the Ice Age&rdquo; as a
whole.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_11" href="#fn_4_11">[11]</a> Some added factor must be found. One which
he considers is a migration of the north pole from the
direction of the Pacific to its present location; Zeuner
and others think the movement occurred before the
Great Ice Age.</p>
<p>Two geologists, Maurice Ewing and William L.
Donn, have accounted for the beginning of the Ice Age
by accepting the theory that the north and south poles
had moved from the north Pacific and the south Atlantic
to their present positions. They account rather
ingeniously for the advance and the retreat of the four
glaciations. With the north pole where it is now, the
ice-free Arctic Ocean would supply moisture by evaporation.
This moisture, owing to cold over the northern
areas of Asia and North America, would fall as snow
to nourish glaciers. But how to stop this process and
<span class="pb" id="Page_57">57</span>
reverse it? It happens that the sea floor forms a rather
high sill between the Atlantic and the Arctic Oceans.
When the sea level dropped, as its water piled up in
the great glaciers, the sill came too close to the surface
to allow much of the warmer water from the Atlantic
to reach the Arctic Ocean and to keep it from freezing
over. Once the ice pack formed, evaporation diminished
abruptly. The glaciers lost their nourishment.
The summer melt returned their waters to the ocean.
Sea level rose. The currents from the Atlantic could
flow over the sill again and melt the ice pack. Then
conditions would be ripe for a second advance of snow
and ice across the northern world. The shallow waters
of Bering Strait probably had little effect upon the
Arctic Ocean.</p>
<p>This theory has been criticized adversely by various
authorities, despite the geologic, oceanographic, and
meteorological evidence that Ewing and Donn have
brought to bear upon each step of their reasoning.
Their theory is particularly attractive to the archaeologist;
it requires an ice-free Arctic coast when the land-bridge
at Bering Strait would have been available to
early man. Climatic conditions at that time would have
been severe along the land-bridge and coastline, but
not impossible for the survival of early man.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_12" href="#fn_4_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>Another explanation is a general decrease in solar
energy; Zeuner holds this in reserve for lack of evidence.
But some present-day geologists seize on the
possibility that the heat of the sun may have changed
from time to time, and use the theory in a curious,
almost paradoxical way. The author of this hypothesis,
Sir George C. Simpson, believes that the great masses
of ice resulted from an initial <i>increase</i> instead of a decrease
in temperature.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_13" href="#fn_4_13">[13]</a> As the weather grew slightly
warmer, cloudiness and rain and snow increased, the
snow-line fell, and glaciation resulted. As the weather
grew still warmer, the ice melted. (Simpson demonstrated
the basic principle of this through an ingenious
laboratory experiment.) His glacial theory, which is
explained in more detail on the opposite page, postulates
two increases in solar energy, and draws from
them a meteorological pattern that provides the four
glacial and three interglacial periods. The first and last
interglacials would be warm and wet, the second cold
and dry. Zeuner objects to this theory on the ground
that the last interglacial&mdash;which, according to Simpson,
should have been warm and wet&mdash;was mainly cool and
dry.<a class="fn" id="fr_4_14" href="#fn_4_14">[14]</a> But, while it may have been cool and dry in the
German area which Zeuner has most closely studied,
other areas probably had other climates. Simpson&rsquo;s hypothesis
would account for the heavy rains, or pluvial
periods, of Nilotic Africa, which may link up with the
glaciations of Europe; but he provides only two pluvials,
and there are evidences of three or more in
Africa.</p>

<p class="caption">GLACIATION THROUGH WARMTH</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>A somewhat modified graph of Simpson&rsquo;s theory of the
cause of the Great Ice Age. The following summary by
Carl Sauer includes quotations from Simpson: [First] &ldquo;Increased
solar radiation received by the earth leads to increase
in the general circulation of the atmosphere, which
forms a great cloud blanket and causes increased precipitation
in appropriate areas. In particular, in high latitudes
and altitudes there is increased snowfall or glaciers.
[Second] &lsquo;As the radiation increases still further, the ice melts
away and we have overcast skies and much precipitation
but no ice accumulation.&rsquo; [Third] &lsquo;When the solar radiation
decreases, conditions are reversed and the whole sequence
is gone through in reverse order.&rsquo;&rdquo; (After Simpson,
1938; quotation from Sauer, 1944.)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Zeuner has an explanation of why the periodic decrease
in the heat from the sun produced glaciation
during the last million years and not for 200,000,000
years before. He introduces the geological factor called
Eustatism,<a class="fn" id="fr_4_15" href="#fn_4_15">[15]</a> meaning by it simply a progressive drop
in sea level. According to the hypothesis, this began
before the Great Ice Age, and was caused by the sinking
of very deep portions of the sea floor. As the sea
level sank, the temperature of the mountains and
plains dropped also, for the higher we rise above the
surface of the ocean the cooler the air grows. The snowline
fell, the mountain glaciers grew larger, and the
snow and ice on the northern plains could not be completely
melted by the reduced summer heat, and gradually
<span class="pb" id="Page_60">60</span>
grew deeper and more extensive. Thus the lowering
of general temperature made it possible for the
periodic decrease in solar radiation to cause the glaciations
of the Great Ice Age. The theory of a general and
steady lowering of the sea level is based on a series of
four raised beaches occurring uniformly in many parts
of the world. Other students believe these terraces
were products of a regional rise of land.</p>
<p>Considering that the Great Ice Age ranges back at
least 600,000 years&mdash;and probably 1,000,000, if we
credit evidence of three earlier Danubian glaciations&mdash;it
is small wonder that scientists are not entirely
agreed on many factors in its story. &ldquo;The difficulties
are such,&rdquo; says the French archaeologist A. Vayson de
Pradenne, &ldquo;that after fifty years of study to which the
greatest geologists have devoted all their energies,
there is no certainty yet as to the exact number of glaciations
and the way in which the faunal changes are
related to them.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_4_16" href="#fn_4_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>Much more important, of course, than the cause of
glaciation is its effect on early man. Ice covered 27 per
cent of the earth&rsquo;s surface during the W&uuml;rm-Wisconsin
period, according to Flint. This created the land-bridge
over Bering Strait. It connected Santa Rosa
Island with the coast of California. It broadened the
Isthmus of Panama, so that man did not have to pass
through a semi-mountainous jungle, which suggests
that he came south during the Wisconsin glaciation. It
seems to have been the ice that urged man to the south
in the Americas and provided freeways.</p>

<h3>Archaeology, a New Science</h3>
<p>Archaeology&mdash;digging
up the ancient past&mdash;is a fairly young science. It is not
so young, of course, as electronics or aerodynamics or
radiology. It is not so old as astronomy or mathematics
or metallurgy. Excavation began in 1748 with the uncovering
of Pompeii; but it was hardly scientific, and it
reached only a short distance into the past. The deciphering
of the Egyptian hieroglyphics in 1819 and of
cuneiform writing in 1837 pushed back history two or
three thousand years. But deep explorations of man&rsquo;s
prehistoric past won no serious status until the middle
of the nineteenth century. &ldquo;In 1859 prehistoric archaeology,&rdquo;
says Gordon Childe, referring to the acceptance
of finds at Abbeville, in France, &ldquo;may be deemed to
have become a science.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_1" href="#fn_5_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>There were discoveries before that, but they were
neglected and misinterpreted or despised and disputed.
As early as 1690 a man named Conyers discovered
&ldquo;opposite Black Mary&rsquo;s, near Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane,&rdquo;
London, a fossilized tooth which, we now know, belonged
to an extinct elephant, and a crude hand ax of
stone which, we now recognize, was made by man
fairly early in the Great Ice Age; but it was long before
<span class="pb" id="Page_62">62</span>
they won an honored place in the British Museum. A
friend of Conyers named Bagford thought that the elephant
belonged to the Roman army of the Emperor
Claudius, and that the flint was a weapon used by a
Briton to slay it (see illustration below).</p>
<div class="img" id="fig15">
<img src="images/i011.jpg" alt="" width="296" height="499" />
<p class="pcapc"><i>The first hand ax found and recognized, probably an
Acheulean implement, discovered in London in 1690 together
with the tooth of an extinct elephant. The tool is
about six inches in length. Like almost all hand axes, it is
thinner than it looks from this angle. (After Sottas, 1911.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>In 1797 John Frere reported to the Society of Antiquaries
on the finding near Hoxne in Suffolk of &ldquo;weapons
of war ... in great numbers&rdquo; together with &ldquo;some
extraordinary bones, particularly a jawbone of enormous
size.&rdquo; His discovery has been called as important,
in its way, as the geographical discovery of a New
World; by emphasizing &ldquo;the situation in which these
weapons were found,&rdquo; he became the first man to apply
modern archaeological methods to a prehistoric
find. Frere boldly declared that the hand axes belonged
to a &ldquo;very remote period indeed; even beyond that of
the present world.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_2" href="#fn_5_2">[2]</a> (See illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_71">page 71</a>.)</p>
<p>Frere&rsquo;s reasoning had little effect, however, on a certain
type of mind. When in 1823 William Buckland,
<span class="pb" id="Page_63">63</span>
a teacher of geology who was to become Dean of
Westminster, dug out of a cave near Paviland a female
skeleton which was painted with red ocher&mdash;a peculiar
habit of early man and of man not so early&mdash;and which
lay beside some ivory rods and bracelets and the skull
of a mammoth, Protestant prejudice got the better of
science. Buckland wrote that the skeleton was &ldquo;<i>clearly</i>
not coeval with the antediluvian bones of the extinct
species&rdquo; with which it had been found. Like Bagford,
he turned to the time of the Roman invasion. His &ldquo;Red
Lady of Paviland&rdquo; became a camp follower, and thus
he missed his chance to recognize the first Cro-Magnon
skeleton of man from the last glaciation.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_3" href="#fn_5_3">[3]</a> Yet religious
dogma&mdash;which held back Victorian science for so many
years&mdash;did not prevent Father John MacEnery from
seeing the true significance of a flint tool and the tooth
of a rhinoceros which he found under a layer of stalagmite
in Kent&rsquo;s Cavern, England, in 1825. Around 1830
Toumal, a French scientist, and Schmerling, a Belgian,
saw the truth as clearly, and published their discoveries
of man-made flints with the fossils of extinct
animals.</p>
<p>The most important find, and the one that ultimately
established Glacial man as a reality, was announced in
1838 at a meeting of the Soci&eacute;t&eacute; d&rsquo;Emulation of Abbeville
in northern France; but twenty years passed before
it received scientific sanction. The discoverer was
an inconspicuous tax collector, Jacques Boucher de
Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur de Perthes, who matched his diversified
name by writing tragedies, novels, and books on travel,
economics, and philanthropy. He had explored caves
as early as 1805 and had found fossils and man-made
tools of flint, but no hand axes. The hand axes that he
found in the river terraces were hardly as important
as his theory that these terraces dated the tools, and
that the terraces were formed far in the past when the
rivers were swollen with water. His only mistake was
<span class="pb" id="Page_64">64</span>
that he went to the biblical flood to find the water instead
of to the great glaciers. In 1849, after making
other finds, Boucher published <i>De l&rsquo;Industrie primitive,
ou Les Arts et leurs origines</i>, dated 1847; more
finds and other books followed. His hand axes and
other discoveries were almost completely ignored until
1858 when the English geologist Hugh Falconer &ldquo;happened
to be passing through Abbeville and saw the
collection.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_4" href="#fn_5_4">[4]</a> He brought British colleagues back to
Abbeville, and in 1859 Falconer, Sir Joseph Prestwich,
and Sir John Evans declared officially for the reality of
glacial man. The finds of Boucher, they asserted,
proved that human beings had existed at the same time
as Pleistocene mammals now extinct. Significantly, it
was the same year that Darwin published <i>On the Origin
of Species by Means of Natural Selection</i>.</p>
<h3>Mortillet&rsquo;s Cramping Classification</h3>
<p>Progress thereafter
was rapid, perhaps too rapid. Notable finds were
soon followed by attempts to freeze knowledge into
chronologic classifications. R. Rigollot, Gabriel de Mortillet,
Edouard Lartet, Milne-Edwards, and Henry
Christy found in the river terraces and the caves of
France innumerable and varied evidences of man&rsquo;s activity
in the Great Ice Age. Mortillet named various
cultures from the places where stone tools were
found, and then, in 1869, he set them up in a chronological
series.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_5" href="#fn_5_5">[5]</a> Modified by later discoveries, the series
ran as follows, beginning with the oldest: Chellean,
Acheulean, Mousterian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, and
Magdalenian. (Most prehistorians now use the word
Abbevillian instead of Chellean because later research
proved that the tools found originally at Chelles were
Acheulean in type, while those found at Abbeville
were earlier.) In the light of present knowledge, the
list is much too simplified. It is based only on European
finds, yet it is supposed to fit the world picture. For
<span class="pb" id="Page_65">65</span>
more than fifty years it has served as a scientific straitjacket,
patched with new material here and there, but
still gaping at the seams as the husky young giant of
archaeological science grows in stature.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>Time scale of early man in a limited area of Europe, as
estimated by Robert J. Braidwood.</i></p>
</div>
<h3>Enter the Eolith</h3>
<p>One of the early difficulties that
Mortillet&rsquo;s list of cultures encountered was the discovery
of implements that preceded his first culture, the
Chellean&mdash;or Abbevillian&mdash;in time and type. Cruder
axes from older levels had to be called Pre-Chellean
(see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_71">page 71</a>). In England scrapers and
other crude tools cropped up in formations that go
back more than 500,000 years.</p>
<p>Then eoliths&mdash;&ldquo;dawn stones&rdquo;&mdash;appeared. They were
irregular-shaped pieces of flint with chips knocked off
here and there. Often the chipping looked purposeful;
the flakes made an edge or a point that could be used
to scrape or drill.</p>
<p>These rudely shaped flints were first championed by
Abb&eacute; Louis Bourgeois in 1863; but his finds were in
strata far too old to win scientific recognition. This was
not the case with Benjamin Harrison, who recognized
eoliths in later formations almost one hundred years
ago. Harrison was one of that variegated and comradely
group of country &ldquo;antiquaries&rdquo;&mdash;noblemen and
shopkeepers, vicars and village laborers&mdash;who founded
and developed the study of the prehistory of England.
Harrison left his old-fashioned general store
and its cakes, fruits, and draperies, to walk the High
Downs of Suffolk, searching with utter conviction for
traces of early man in the glacial gravels. He began as
a youth, when Boucher de Cr&egrave;vec&oelig;ur de Perthes had
only just won his battle, and in 1865 he recognized his
first eoliths. In 1889 the distinguished scientist Sir
Joseph Prestwich gave them his backing. It took twenty
more years, however, for the eolith to win anything
like respectable recognition, and some still deny that
these flints were worked by men.</p>

<p>The fact that some eoliths were found in geological
formations much older than man&mdash;so far as we know
his history&mdash;was an argument against all of them, because
the older and the more recent looked so much
alike. Another cogent objection was that eoliths could
have been made by natural forces, such as a landslide,
the pressure of heavy strata, or one stone knocking
against another. A heavy cart can make an eolith
when it rolls over a smooth flint. But in spite of arguments
and antagonisms, which still persist, there were
two things that seemed to establish the eolith as the
work of man.</p>
<p>To begin with, some kind of tool, some form of experiment,
had to lie behind even the crudest hand ax.
At first man must have picked up a natural eolith and
used its cutting edge. A little later he must have improved
the edge. In any case he threw the stone away
when he had finished the job, and later looked for and
improved another one. Gradually he developed his
dawn-stone technique and made tools that he would
use until he lost them.</p>
<p>The second argument for the dawn stone was impressive.
In 1910, after years of search, J. Reid Moir
found eoliths near Ipswich, England, under unusual
conditions. They came in two layers, which seemed to
indicate that early man had camped twice in this
neighborhood at different times. They were bedded in
soft sand and therefore could not have been chipped
by geologic pressure. The sand dated from the Pliocene
<span class="pb" id="Page_68">68</span>
Period which preceded the Great Ice Age. Later, in
the same district, he found eoliths in a layer of delicate
shells&mdash;again a sign that the eoliths had not been
chipped by natural forces.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_6" href="#fn_5_6">[6]</a> Moreover, many of Moir&rsquo;s
eoliths had a new and peculiar shape; they were
keeled like an upturned boat or beaked like an eagle.
Sir Ray Lankester called them rostrocarinates. In 1900
Mortillet had to admit man&mdash;or pre-man&mdash;to an Eolithic
Age.</p>
<h3>Flake vs. Core Industries</h3>
<p>More difficulties beset Mortillet
and his system of names and cultures as time
passed and as fellow scientists dug new caves and terraces,
and turned up stone tools of other patterns and
other periods. Implements appeared that did not fit
into the Frenchman&rsquo;s classic system. A supplementary
scheme had to be devised, and soon it, too, failed to fit
the facts.</p>
<p>The new system divided all paleolithic tools into two
types&mdash;which was sound enough&mdash;and assigned each
type to certain peoples and to those peoples only&mdash;which
proved not so sound. The division lay between
cores and flakes. It lay between tools that had been
made out of the heart of a lump of flint, and tools that
had been made from chips flaked off the lump. The
fact that there were core tools and flake tools was plain
enough, but the fondness of scientists for strict classification
led the prehistorians into theories that time disproved.</p>
<p>First of all, they had to set up a time sequence. They
decided, not unnaturally, that man must have begun
by hammering things with a handy rock until his rude
tool began to chip away into something approaching
an edge and eventually a point. Thus the hand ax, or
<i>coup de poing</i>, came into being (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_71">page 71</a>).
In the course of time man began to notice the
chips, and to use the larger ones to cut and scrape with.
<span class="pb" id="Page_69">69</span>
Soon&mdash;that is, after a couple of hundred thousand years&mdash;he
was deliberately knocking flakes off a stone core,
and using them for spear points as well as scrapers.
The prehistorians called hand axes the products of a
&ldquo;core industry,&rdquo; and chips the products of a &ldquo;flake industry.&rdquo;
They believed that one industry had preceded
the other by hundreds of thousands of years, and that
the Abbevillian and Acheulean had stuck to cores and
left flakes to the Mousterian. Thus they believed that
certain cultures had devoted themselves exclusively to
the core, and certain others to the flake.</p>
<p>The theory that the early stone workers had a core
industry and the later ones worked flakes was rudely
upset by the discovery of flaked tools&mdash;called Cromerian&mdash;in
an English stratum as old as the French sources
of the first hand axes, and possibly older. Some say they
lie at the beginning of the Great Ice Age or at the end
of the earlier period, the Pliocene. This demonstration
of a very early flake industry was reenforced by the
discovery of a special type of flaked tool&mdash;the Clactonian&mdash;which
runs from late Abbevillian into Acheulean
times. Another type&mdash;the Levalloisian&mdash;laps over from
the Acheulean into the Mousterian.</p>
<p>The core industries and the flake industries simply
would not stay nicely separated. The first excavators
had found only hand axes because these tools
were so much more interesting than scrapers; later
students found flake tools in the same ancient levels.
No hand axes turned up in Clactonian culture-sites, but
they appeared at the end of the Levallois, and the
flake-loving Mousterians made them for a time. &ldquo;Flake
and core run parallel to one another in time,&rdquo; says W.
B. Wright, &ldquo;and even intermix.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_7" href="#fn_5_7">[7]</a></p>

Indian cultures hafted at the top of a wooden handle
or in the middle, as a sort of spokeshave. (After Osborn,

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>If we do not try to apply the core-versus-flake theory
too broadly and too strictly, it suggests a fascinating
picture of two kinds of men and two kinds of life
through the first two-thirds of the Great Ice Age. One
kind dominated during the cold of the glaciations; the
other, during the warmth of the interglacials. For the
flake tools of the Clactonian and Levalloisian peoples
are found mainly with the fossils of cold-loving animals
in the north and east of Europe, and the core tools of
the Abbevillian and Acheulean peoples with warmer-blooded
animals in the west and south.</p>
<p>Science accepted Mortillet&rsquo;s system of orderly cultures
and the theory of successive core and flake industries,
and for fifty years tried to apply it to new
discoveries both in Europe and elsewhere. Though the
system has had to be modified in parts, and in parts
abandoned, its terms are still used, and used in a way
that is confusing because the terms are no longer exact.
In Africa the various types of tools resemble only approximately
those of Europe, and they do not seem
to correspond in time. The hand ax may have spread
from Spain into almost all Africa, or, more probably,
from Africa into Spain, as well as southern India, but
there are plenty of flaked tools, too, in these regions.
Central and northern Asia seem to be devoted to the
flake, and to eschew the hand ax in favor of a kind of
chopping tool made out of a core. Asia, like Africa, has
tools made out of large, smooth pebbles.</p>
<h3>Dating Early Man in Europe</h3>
<p>One good thing can be
said for Mortillet&rsquo;s modified sequence of Abbevillian,
Acheulean, Mousterian, Aurignacian, Solutrean, and
Magdalenian. It may not be complete enough, and it
may not apply too well to the world outside Europe;
but it is chronologically sound locally. It is a succession
of cultures along a time scale. If an archaeologist finds
two or more varieties of paleolithic tools in a new site,
he finds, for example, Acheulean beneath Mousterian,
or Mousterian beneath Aurignacian. Similarly, when he
comes upon Abbevillian and Acheulean in separate
terraces of the same river, he always finds the Abbevillian
<span class="pb" id="Page_73">73</span>
in a higher terrace than the Acheulean, and, as we
have explained on pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_51">51</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_52">52</a>, the higher terrace
is always the older.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i015.jpg" alt="Timeline" width="600" height="141" />
</div>
<p>Dating these cultures in terms of our years is another
matter. The first step is fairly simple. If the tools
are found with the fossils of a warmth-loving animal
like the hippopotamus, they belong to an interglacial
period; if they are found with the fossils of an animal
like the hairy mammoth, which could survive a harsh
climate, they belong to a glacial time. The species of
animal may determine which glacial or which interglacial.
If the tools are found in the gravel of a certain
river terrace, then they belong to the geological period
when the material of the terrace was being laid down.
The terraces often contain fossils, and this may cross-date
the terrace materials with cave deposits. But
scientists are often faced with the problem of picking
the right glacial or interglacial period on scanty evidence,
and the still more difficult problem of setting
the period in the terms of our years. There is room here
for much disagreement. Glaciologists do not agree as
to the age or the length of the various glacials and interglacials
(see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_55">page 55</a>). Some prehistorians
accept and use the dates of one glacialist; some choose
another&rsquo;s. They do not all concur as to which culture
came in which glacial period.</p>
<h3>True Tools&mdash;Deceptive Skulls</h3>
<p>Men who practiced
Abbevillian culture had some flaked tools&mdash;which they
may have used for scraping&mdash;but their best-recognized
output was a crude hand ax. It was not too well formed.
Undoubtedly they also used wood and bone, but we
have no sure evidence of this. Some assign Abbevillian
culture to the first interglacial period, about 500,000
years ago. Some move it up 200,000 years, into the second
interglacial. Some even place it in the third. Perhaps
it lasted through all three. At any rate, the men
who made it liked a fairly warm climate. As neither
they nor their Acheulean successors made fire or controlled
it effectively, the early Europeans probably retreated
to Africa during the glaciations.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>The Acheulean hand ax was thinner and better, and
it is found with various kinds of scrapers and cleavers.
Probably it was this culture that left us part of a very
crude wooden spear at Clacton-on-Sea, in England,
though some date it a little later. The earliest association
of human remains with tools in Europe is that of
the Swanscombe skull and Acheulean tools in Pleistocene
gravels of the Thames in Kent.</p>
<p>We are not too sure about the physical appearance
of the men of Abbevillian and Acheulean times. For
the Abbevillian there is possibly a fragment of jaw, a
most interesting one, to be sure, but not actually found
with any kind of artifact. For Acheulean times there
are no dependable skeletons to help us, and not even
complete skulls. In fact, there are not as many candidates
for the position as we thought we had a decade
or so ago.</p>
<p>Galley Hill man turned out to be a case of mistaken
identity. He has a thick skull and a few other primitive
traits&mdash;a fossil type of modern man, perhaps, but not
nearly as old as we once thought. His bones lacked
<span class="pb" id="Page_76">76</span>
a fluorine mineral content typical of other fossils that
belonged in the interglacial deposits where the Galley
Hill skull reposed, eight feet below the surface.</p>
<p>The same fluorine test&mdash;which fortunately applies to
such fossilated things as bone, antler, and ivory&mdash;exposed
an even more notorious impostor, expelling him
from the select corps of early men. This was Piltdown
man, alias <i>Homo eoanthropus dawsoni</i>, alias <i>Eoanthropus</i>,
alias Dawson&rsquo;s Dawn Man. It was demonstrated
to be a fake and a forgery that led its discoverer
to try to match a reasonably human skull to
the jaw of an ape. The jaw and its teeth had been
modified by the faker&mdash;not Dawson&mdash;to make it appear
less apelike. Both jaw and skull had been artfully
treated with chemicals to appear as antiquated as the
unusual assortment of fossils with which they were
salted into early interglacial deposits. Many of the fossils,
while authentic in their own right, also were chemically
stained and planted. And tools were added to
complete the assemblage. The latter included a bone
pick thoughtfully carved from the femur of an elephant,
but it was carved with a modern steel knife, as
careful scrutiny under a powerful lens disclosed, and
not with the stone flakes of prehistoric man. (See illustration,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_74">page 74</a>.)</p>
<p>The British scientists Kenneth Oakley, J. S. Wiener,
and Sir Wilfrid Le Gros Clark exposed the forgery
in a most conclusive manner.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_9" href="#fn_5_9">[9]</a> In laying the ghost of
Piltdown, these authorities resolved four decades of
controversy as to his place in human evolution. Although
Piltdown&rsquo;s contribution to human evolution
now is known to have been nil, his contribution to
physical anthropology has been considerable. As the
academic dust settled on this issue, the anthropologists
returned to their laboratories with greater confidence
in their science and with somewhat sharper tools in
<span class="pb" id="Page_77">77</span>
their research kits. It is unlikely that any new hoax
will ever acquire the same importance as Piltdown.</p>
<h3>Ancestors from Heidelberg and Swanscombe?</h3>
<p>We
still have at least four authentically early human fossils
from which European men may have descended. Each
has its own interesting story.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_10" href="#fn_5_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>The fragment of jaw found under 80 feet of sand
at Mauer, Germany, we call Heidelberg man, although
he is the least human of the lot. He seems also to be
the most ancient, perhaps belonging to the first interglacial
period. At least the bones of horses, elephants,
bears, and other animals found at the same level in the
sand pit derive from the early stages of the Ice Age.
Heidelberg man clearly lacks a chin, and his molar
teeth are reminiscent in some ways of cattle rather than
men or even monkeys, for that matter. This is an important
clue, for the same thing, &ldquo;taurodontism,&rdquo; occurs
much later among some of the Neanderthals.</p>
<p>Heidelberg was not found with or near any stone
tools. He seems to belong to that part of the Pleistocene
in which the Abbevillian tools were made. Although
he shares a few physical traits with Neanderthal man,
who lived much later and made excellent tools, some
specialists point out that the Heidelberg jaw bears an
even closer resemblance to the early man-apes of South
Africa, who had no toolmaking tradition.</p>
<p>For the long, cool, and somewhat arid second interglacial
period, we have two good prospects, both
probably females. One of these is from Swanscombe.
In 1936, A. T. Marston found there among the undisturbed
Middle Gravels a fragment of fossil skull. Except
for its unusual thickness, it was not unlike an
equivalent portion in the skull of modern man. Marston&rsquo;s
discovery was all the more exciting since this
fragment fitted very well with another, obviously from
<span class="pb" id="Page_78">78</span>
the same skull, which he had found in place the previous
year, only a few paces away. The two pieces, from
the left side and back of the skull, provided the earliest
undisputed evidence for a very early form of modern
man. Twenty years later, in 1955, Mr. J. Wymer recovered
a third fragment, from the right side of the
same skull. The spots from which the three fragments
of the Swanscombe skull were recovered mark a triangle,
the sides of which measure 24, 49, and 51 feet.
Near the Swanscombe bones and at the same level
were found more than two hundred stone flakes as well
as four small hand axes of Acheulean type, a stone
knife, and fragments of other tools. As we have mentioned,
the gravels appear to be an undisturbed deposit.
Accordingly, they are now adequately protected
and the object of a most intensive and careful excavation.
From them may come yet more information about
this ancient ancestor.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_11" href="#fn_5_11">[11]</a></p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i016a.jpg" alt="Timeline" width="600" height="145" />
</div>
<p>This is early man, indeed. Swanscombe, from all the
evidence now available, is very close physically to modern
man, closer than many fossil men from the third
interglacial period. And judging from the accompanying
stone tools, we may say that Swanscombe was culturally
as well as physically human.</p>
<p>Until additional remains of Swanscombe are recovered,
we cannot with certainty assign these remains to
a precise place among man&rsquo;s ancestors. There are a few
who suspect that the facial bones, should these be recovered,
would place Swanscombe closer to Neanderthal
than to modern man. However profitless such a
conjecture may seem, it is at least suggested by our
third early European fossil, the Steinheim skull.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>Twenty-three feet beneath the surface in a gravel
quarry at Steinheim, Germany, this now famous skull
was found. First reported in 1933 by Curator Fritz
K. H. Berckheimer, of the nearby Stuttgart Natural
History Museum, this skull was well within a layer of
gravels which now are believed to be of second interglacial
age. Steinheim is now considered more or less
a contemporary of Swanscombe, perhaps just slightly
less ancient. In the Steinheim skull there is a strong
resemblance to the Swanscombe skull and to that of
modern man. But most of the right side of the Steinheim
face is intact, along with a few molar teeth, and
in these there is little likeness to <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>
<p>Given the Swanscombe bones alone, probably no
anatomist would dream of constructing for it a Neanderthal-like
face. But in the Steinheim skull there
can be no mistake. Here we find a skull of reasonably
modern shape but equipped with enormous bony
ridges over the eye sockets, a markedly broad nose,
and a somewhat projecting mouth&mdash;all suggestive of
Neanderthal. In the main, even these features may be
somewhat closer to an early type of modern man. It
has been asked: Could Steinheim be an ancestor to
both Neanderthal and modern man?</p>
<h3>Putting the Neanderthal in His Place</h3>
<p>Neanderthal
man was a latecomer. We will mention him here but
wait until farther along to take a closer look at him.
He came to Europe late in the third interglacial period.
His culture was advanced and his remains are diverse,
numerous, and well studied. His bones differ so distinctly
from those of modern man that at most he can
be considered a distant cousin, only marginally ancestral.
But his remains immediately precede those of
modern man in Europe, and the stone tools of his
Mousterian culture are found directly under those of
modern types of early Europeans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>It was, therefore, with something akin to relief that
anthropologists received the findings of Mlle. Henri-Martin
at Fontechevade. This was in 1947, some 90
years after Neanderthal had been academically accepted
for what he was, an effectively extinct kind of
non-sapiens man. At Fontechevade, in Charente, west
central France, is a cave in which the litter of millenniums
discloses a cultural record ranging from that of
recent Frenchmen back through the Old Stone Age,
which includes the tools and debris of the Neanderthals&rsquo;
Mousterian culture. The Mousterian materials
were bottommost, resting upon what seemed to be the
cave floor. Mlle. Henri-Martin noted that this &ldquo;floor&rdquo;
was in fact a thick layer of stalagmite deposit, and she
began excavating. Upon breaking through this culturally
sterile layer, the archaeologist came to more than
20 feet of additional deposits above the actual floor. In
these lower levels, the cultural debris represented quite
a different tool-manufacturing tradition, the Tayacian.
This featured crude flake tools, rather than worked
cores. With the flake tools there were fragments of fossil
mammals, dating the deposit as third interglacial.
There also was a human skullcap and a fragment of a
second skull. Not much to go on, but it was sufficient
to show that these were the remains not of Neanderthal
man but of something closer to modern man in most
respects, and perhaps to Swanscombe. Here, for the
first time, was clear and unmistakable proof that a
more modern form of man definitely preceded the
brutish Neanderthal. Fontechevade man resembled
<i>Homo sapiens</i> more than Neanderthal&mdash;the first evidence
that the latter was not our direct ancestor.</p>
<p>These four early men&mdash;Heidelberg, Swanscombe,
Steinheim, and Fontechevade&mdash;are of unquestionable
antiquity. There are many other fossil men from
Europe, equally interesting but less reliably dated. In
addition there are hosts of Africans and Asians who,
<span class="pb" id="Page_81">81</span>
perhaps, are really of greater consequence in human
evolution. None of these is dated as well as the early
Europeans, whose bones and stone tools can be assigned
to rather specific periods within the sequence of
glacial and interglacial phases of the Ice Age.</p>
<h3>Ancient Man in Java and China</h3>
<p>In the 1880&rsquo;s a Dutch
Army surgeon named Eug&egrave;ne Dubois decided to go to
Java to find a kind of ape-man that the great German
scientist Ernst Haeckel had envisioned fifteen years
before. In 1891, beneath ancient deposits of the Solo
River, Dubois discovered what he was looking for&mdash;or
perhaps a slight improvement on it. What he found
was the skull top, two molar teeth, and a thigh bone of
a thing which was much more man than ape, but
which received the name <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i>
(erect ape-man). For some years the skullcap of this
Java man&mdash;a handier name&mdash;stood alone as the only
fossil of really ancient man. Now it has been joined by
portions of two other adults from the same geological
level and the cranium of a child and portions of a
rugged, robust male skull from a still older level, the
discoveries of G. H. R. von Koenigswald. Reconstructions
of Java man give us a fellow with a low sloping
forehead, no chin, not much room for brains, and a
very prominent ridge of bone above his eyes. This human
of 300,000 or more years ago probably looked a
good deal like the most primitive of modern men, the
native Australians, who seem to have miraculously
and uniquely survived without much change from the
beginnings of <i>Homo</i>. Java man left no tools with his
bones, but the massive Patjitanian stone choppers and
crude flakes found in southern Java are thought to be
of about the proper age.</p>

above was all that Dubois first found of Java man. The
reconstruction, actually the right side of the skull, has
been reversed for comparison. (The skullcap after Osborn,
1915; the reconstruction after Weinert, 1928.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Java man has a slightly younger relative in Peking
man, also beetle-browed. The first finds were made in
1929, about forty miles southwest of Peking in the
Choukoutien Cave, on Dragon Bone Hill. Since then
parts of about forty men and women have been dug
out. We now have four skulls that are more complete
than those of Java man. We also have 148 teeth and
thirteen jaws, and some odd pieces of other skulls. We
have fire hearths and a large number of implements,
ranging from eoliths to hammerstones and crude choppers
and scrapers. We also have some fossil bones of
monkey, baboon, ostrich, rhinoceros, and mammoth,
besides animals common to China today. The most interesting
bones, of course, are those of man himself,
and our concern with them is increased by the odd and
disturbing fact that the thigh bones had been cracked
for their marrow as only a man could crack them, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_83">83</span>
the skulls had suffered violence. If Peking man was not
a cannibal, he had a neighbor who was. And that is
probably true for the Abbevillian and Acheulean times
of Europe. But at least Peking man, like Java man,
stood erect.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Giant Ape&rdquo;&mdash;a Mythical Ancestor?</h3>
<p>Behind Java and
Peking man, it was once supposed, a giant ancestor
lurked. Ideas of giants occur in the myths and folklore
of most peoples, but here the germ was planted by
reputable scientists. It began between 1935 and 1939,
when von Koenigswald discovered in a Hong Kong
apothecary&rsquo;s shop three molars that had six times the
volume of our teeth and were greater than the equivalent
teeth in any other man or ape, living or fossil.
Their owner obviously was related to man, but how
closely we cannot guess. He was promptly dubbed
&ldquo;giant ape,&rdquo; <i>Gigantopithecus</i>. Then, in Java in 1941,
von Koenigswald recovered part of a massive jaw
with a few huge teeth intact. Their great size again
prompted a fanciful name, &ldquo;the giant man of ancient
Java,&rdquo; or <i>Meganthropus palaeojavanicus</i>.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig22">
<img src="images/i017a.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="194" />
<p class="pcapc">Gigantopithecus&mdash;<i>giant ancestor of man? A normal human
molar contrasted with one of a number of teeth found
in a Hong Kong store. (After Koenigswald, 1947.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Professor Franz Weidenreich speculated that the
Hong Kong teeth would require a beast twice the bulk
of a gorilla, while the jaw and teeth of the Java &ldquo;giant&rdquo;
indicated an ancient man half again as large as a gorilla.
Gorillas stand, quite uncomfortably, five and a
half feet or so; some weigh more than 600 pounds.
<span class="pb" id="Page_84">84</span>
Further evidence appeared in 1957, when Pei Wenchung
reported the discovery in Kwangsi Province,
China, of a jaw bone with teeth, which he claimed to
be <i>Gigantopithecus</i>. Pei added that it was closer to
man than any other ape yet discovered, and he must
have been 12 feet tall.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_12" href="#fn_5_12">[12]</a></p>
<p>The logic of including giants among our ancestors
stems in part from the fact that many Pleistocene mammals
were larger than their modern descendants. What
these great teeth and jaws mean, we do not yet know.
In the complete absence of such clues to stature as
thigh and other bones, there are few who would now
speculate that the huge teeth mean more than a fossil
ape of otherwise moderate proportions. There is not
always an exact correlation between size of teeth and
stature, as comparisons among modern man, Peking
and Java man, and South African man-apes indicate.
The smallest teeth occur among some of the tallest
humans; the largest teeth are found among some of
the smaller man-apes.</p>
<h3>&ldquo;Java&rdquo; Men in Africa and Europe?</h3>
<p>Halfway around
the world, at Ternifine, near Oran, in Algeria, Professor
Camille Arambourg recovered a portion of a youthful
skull and three jaws in 1954-55. He called these <i>Atlanthropus</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_13" href="#fn_5_13">[13]</a>
This was not a valid new genus, however,
for there are strong resemblances between these
jaws and those of Peking and Java man. Here is an
African cousin of <i>Pithecanthropus</i>. (There are others.
A fragment of jaw found near Rabat, in Morocco, also
is thought to resemble Java man.) The Ternifine jaws
seem to belong to the second interglacial period. At
the bottom of an ancient spring from which Arambourg
recovered his fossils, he also found a number of
stone tools, including fist axes of the Acheulean type.
This perhaps is the earliest association of Acheulean
artifacts with human bones. You will recall that Acheulean
<span class="pb" id="Page_85">85</span>
fist axes also were found with Swanscombe. Have
we, then, a single type of culture for two quite different
kinds of men? Our accumulating evidence is beginning
to make it clear that some half-brained form of man
closely related to our Java &ldquo;ape-man&rdquo; was widely distributed
across the inhabitable regions of the Old
World during the long second interglacial period.</p>
<h3>Man-Apes or Ape-Men in Africa</h3>
<p>While Sunday supplements
and scientists alike were occupied with Dubois&rsquo;s
&ldquo;missing link&rdquo; and his Peking cousin, primate
fossils of even greater consequence were being recovered
in southern Africa by Professor Raymond Dart
and the late Dr. Robert Broom. In 1925, Dart named
them <i>Australopithecines</i> or &ldquo;southern apes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_14" href="#fn_5_14">[14]</a> Arousing
little scientific curiosity at first, they were considered
by some as a parallel, perhaps profitless, line of
evolution. By 1950, such fossils were becoming impressively
abundant. A bewildering array of names
was assigned to them, without scientific justification.
The first had been called <i>Australopithecus africanus</i>;
later, another species, <i>prometheus</i>, was added. Others
were labeled as distinct genera, taking note of their
near-human features&mdash;<i>Telanthropus</i>, <i>Plesianthropus</i>,
and <i>Paranthropus</i> (with two species, <i>robustus</i> and
<i>crassidens</i>). In 1959, a new and important form was
added, <i>Zinjanthropus boisei</i>. <i>Zinj</i> is the Arab name for
East Africa. Expert opinion now inclines toward lumping
these all together, possibly under our own genus,
<i>Homo</i>, or at most, within a single genus, <i>Australopithecus</i>.
Their status of &ldquo;ape&rdquo; is being reassessed: man-apes,
some still maintain; ape-men, say others; a few
believe they included the earliest true men.</p>
<p>The dividing line between ape and man is drawn
partly upon physical grounds, but the greatest difference
is a cultural one. Men possess and transmit culture,
a process ordinarily regarded as involving language.
<span class="pb" id="Page_86">86</span>
Men make tools; apes do not. The smallest,
crudest, and perhaps earliest of the <i>Australopithecines</i>
have long been championed by Dart, who argues most
persuasively that they were at least tool users, if not
toolmakers. With their remains were those of other
animals, a source of bones for picks and clubs, teeth
for cutting and scraping, and so on. Perceiving crude,
ready-made tools of bone, tooth, and horn, Dart coined
the term &ldquo;osteodontokeratic&rdquo; for this pre-Stone Age
assemblage.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_15" href="#fn_5_15">[15]</a> This nomenclature was criticized by
physical and cultural anthropologists alike. Whether
this &ldquo;culture&rdquo; of the <i>Australopithecines</i> is real or&mdash;as
many believe&mdash;imagined, there is no doubt about the
equipment of <i>Zinjanthropus</i>. Associated with his bones
are stone tools of the Oldowan culture, an Abbevillian-level,
&ldquo;Pre-Chelles-Acheul&rdquo; industry of worked stone
flakes. In the words of his discoverer, Dr. L. S. B.
Leakey, here was the oldest maker of stone tools so far
known. By 1960, the skull of <i>Zinjanthropus</i> had not
been fully studied. In certain of its features, it favors
<i>Paranthropus</i>, <i>Australopithecus</i>, or <i>Homo</i>. On first
glance it seems as nearly human as Java man, which
Leakey says it predates.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_16" href="#fn_5_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>There are two main difficulties in placing the <i>Australopithecines</i>
on the line of human evolution. Although
they might be said to resemble man more than
the apes, they actually resemble neither, for their features
are so specialized that it is difficult to conceive of
them as ancestral to either. It is difficult, too, to place
them in geologic time. Except for <i>Zinjanthropus</i>, who
clearly belongs to the upper part of the Lower Pleistocene,
most of the <i>Australopithecines</i> have been recovered
from caves, fissures, or other places where there is
no stratification. They are all much too old to be placed
in time by some of our more precise dating techniques,
such as the radiocarbon method. Non-primate bones
found with them are typical of animals that in Europe
<span class="pb" id="Page_87">87</span>
ranged all the way from the Mid-Pliocene to the Mid-Pleistocene.
South Africa is a cul-de-sac, relatively untouched
by the Ice Age. The abundance and variety
of animals surviving today in most of Africa south of
the Sahara are reminiscent of the Pleistocene elsewhere.
The index fossils of other lands are not much
use when it comes to dating <i>Australopithecus</i>.</p>
<p>Once suspected of being Middle Pleistocene at the
earliest, the <i>Australopithecines</i>&rsquo; apparent lack of culture,
their crude development, and relatively small
brain capacity indicated to some authorities that they
were too little and too late to have been ancestral to
man. But given a greater time span-back, say, to the
Late Pliocene&mdash;they could be regarded seriously as
mans ancestors. Somewhat cautiously, Sir Wilfrid E.
Le Gros Clark seems to agree with Dart that, as a
whole, the <i>Australopithecines</i> may well include the
stock from which our own genus was derived.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_17" href="#fn_5_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Back of the <i>Australopithecines</i> are yet other fossils
of great interest, forms intermediate between man and
apes in various ways. These all are utterly lacking in
culture, in our sense of the word. One of the more interesting
fossils is <i>Oreopithecus bambolii</i>, quantities of
which have been recovered from a lignite mine at Baccinello,
Italy.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_18" href="#fn_5_18">[18]</a> These fossils seem to date from about
the Early Pliocene. More than ape or monkey, their
teeth are definitely manlike&mdash;hominid rather than
merely hominoid&mdash;and the size of their brains is about
that of the larger chimpanzees or the smaller <i>Australopithecines</i>.
Future studies surely will indicate if, and
perhaps how, <i>Oreopithecus</i> is related to the South
African man-apes, and to man.</p>
<h3>The Progressive Neanderthal</h3>
<p>Let us get back to Europe
and the next culture in Mortillet&rsquo;s scale. This is the
Mousterian; we know it better by the name of the
place in Germany&mdash;Neanderthal&mdash;where, in 1856, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_88">88</span>
first skeleton of the Mousterian Age was found. It took
thirty years for this skeleton to win scientific recognition,
but now we have about a hundred admitted
specimens.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i018.jpg" alt="Timeline" width="600" height="160" />
</div>
<p>The Neanderthal was not a pretty spectacle. He had
the low forehead and heavy brow ridges of Java and
Peking man, and the same lack of chin. And yet he
was the cleverest fellow by far that had ever lived,
and the most sensitive, which may seem rather odd,
since some of the earlier skulls found in England,
Africa, Java, and Australia come nearer the modern
type of what we call thinking man, <i>Homo sapiens</i>.</p>
<p>On the evidence we have, the Neanderthal seems to
have been the inventor of religion. In his caves we find
burials for the first time, and burials accompanied by
tools for the dead man to use in the other world. We
also find shrines made of the skulls of cave bears.</p>
<p>As a chipper of flint, he was much more skillful than
those that had gone before. He soon gave up making
tools which, like the hand ax, would serve a number of
purposes, but none very well. He invented the stone
spear point. There is still considerable argument about
his flint work, or at least about the technique which he
may or may not have developed.</p>

<p class="caption">MAN&rsquo;S FIRST SPEAR POINTS</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>Two views of a flake of flint that has been chipped on
one face and retouched along the edges by a Neanderthal
man. To remove the tiny lateral chips, he probably held
it with the smoother side against a chunk of wood, and
struck small and careful blows with a hammerstone (as
shown at the bottom of <a class="pgref" href="#Page_91">page 91</a>). Acheulean man may
have used this technique in making the best of his hand
axes. (After Mortillet, 1881.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>When man began to make tools he pounded one
rock with another. He hoped he would knock off just
the right chip in the right spot. This is called the percussion
method of flaking (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_91">page 91</a>).
Some say the Neanderthal was not content with this.
They think that he must have discovered how to place
a piece of bone or very hard wood against a flint at
the point where he wanted to knock off a flake, and
then strike it with a hammerstone (see illustration,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_92">page 92</a>). This might account for the small chips, or
&ldquo;retouches,&rdquo; taken off the edge of some of his spear
points as in the illustration below. Even the Acheuleans
are occasionally credited with this invention because
many of their hand axes are so symmetrical.
There are those who say that the Neanderthal had
progressed so far in flint work that he knew the art of
pressure flaking&mdash;the third step in flint knapping&mdash;which
involved the pressing off of small chips with the
bit of wood or bone held in the hand (see illustration,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_93">page 93</a>). It seems more likely that Neanderthals and
men of Acheulean times used the anvil method of percussion
flaking (lower drawing, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_91">page 91</a>), not an inaccurate
way of knocking off small chips.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<p>The Neanderthal&mdash;with his Mousterian culture&mdash;seems
to have invaded Europe from Asia toward the
end of the third and last interglacial, anywhere from
80,000 to 125,000 years ago, and to have left from 15,000
to 100,000 years ago, depending on what authority
you choose, and how that authority dates the last interglacial.
Unlike his predecessors, the Neanderthal lived
in caves; but that was probably because he was the first
man in Europe to survive a glacial winter&mdash;tens of
thousands of them.</p>
<p>The Neanderthal seems to have disappeared quite
suddenly from Europe, taking his Australoid features
with him. There are traces of him in Africa, and also
in Palestine where he is thought to have produced a
hybrid among the Mount Carmel people. Sir Arthur
Keith said, in 1915, that the Neanderthal never left Europe,
but was merely absorbed into the next peoples.
We can see the Neanderthal profile on an occasional
passer-by.</p>
<p>Most anthropologists are rather cool to the Neanderthal.
They cast him quite outside the sacred ranks of
our ancestors. They say he was not <i>Homo sapiens</i>&mdash;merely
<i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>. This means that he
was a sort of dead end, a blind alley, up which one
sort of ape-man ran, while another was taking a turn
that ended in his being master of the atom but not of
the atomic bomb. Other anthropologists do not agree.
Like Keith, they take the Neanderthal into the sacred
circle&mdash;at least at stud.</p>
<h3>Radiocarbon Dates for the Mousterian</h3>
<p>However
early the Mousterian culture may have begun, the
later stages fall within the range of one of the archaeologist&rsquo;s
most interesting and precise techniques
for dating. This is the radiocarbon, or Carbon 14,
<span class="pb" id="Page_95">95</span>
method.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_19" href="#fn_5_19">[19]</a> Much simplified, it depends upon the following
phenomena: Most plants are radioactive, and
so are all animals that depend directly or indirectly
upon these plants for food. This radioactivity is found
in a rare form of carbon called radiocarbon, or Carbon
14. While a plant or an animal is alive, it contains a
constant proportion of this radioactive material. Radiocarbon
is always breaking down and disappearing, but
while a tree or a bird or another animal lives, this material
is being renewed. When this same tree or animal
dies, it stops acquiring new radiocarbon, and therefore
its radioactivity decreases. Heartwood from a 4,000-year-old
sequoia tree is appreciably less radioactive
than the living outer layer. Antlers shed by a buck in
the last spring are more radioactive than any reindeer
antlers left in a cave in France by Old Stone Age hunters
17,000 years ago.</p>
<p>After death, radiocarbon disappears at a rate of
speed that can be measured. This rate may seem
strange to most laymen. It is based on what physicists
call &ldquo;half-lives.&rdquo; The half-life of radiocarbon is 5,568
years, give or take a few. This means that after 5,568
years, half the radiocarbon is gone. If the material
weighed a pound at the death of the plant or animal,
only half a pound would be left. After another half-life
of the same length, only a quarter of a pound would
remain. And so on and so on. With highly refined techniques,
what is left of this radioactive substance can
be detected in matter 60,000 to 70,000 years old,<a class="fn" id="fr_5_20" href="#fn_5_20">[20]</a> and
it can be measured and its age determined, with a few
percentage points of error, up to at least 50,000 years
ago. The scientist must be sure, however, that the material&mdash;such
as wood, charcoal, peat, antler, shell,
bone, or hair&mdash;has not been exposed to contamination
that would add radiocarbon.</p>
<p>This method of dating, developed by Willard F.
Libby in the late forties, supplied archaeologists with
<span class="pb" id="Page_96">96</span>
fairly close estimates of the age of sites containing
wood, charcoal, shell, or bone.</p>
<p>Neanderthal is the first of our early men to have
lived within the range of radiocarbon dating. To be
more precise, his Mousterian culture has left traces
that can be measured. We have several radiocarbon
measurements that tell us how recently Neanderthal
was around; his oldest cultural materials are beyond
the present range of radiocarbon measurement. At
Godarville, Belgium, Mousterian artifacts were found
underlying an accumulation of peat that dated from
more than 36,000 years ago. Since the stone tools were
deposited before the peat, they must be at least as old.
Charcoal from an ancient hearth in a Libyan cave
at Haua Fteah, associated with Levalloiso-Mousterian
materials and about three feet or so above a Neanderthaloid
jaw, was dated at 34,000 years, or possibly
older. The archaeology of this cave suggests that the
Neanderthal survived in North Africa until about 30,000
years ago. In Israel, south of Haifa in the Mount
Carmel range, at a site called Mugharet-el-Kebara, a
very small sample of charcoal, thought to correlate
with a nearby Levalloiso-Mousterian deposit, furnished
a date of more than 30,000 years.</p>
<p>In the Near East, archaeological excavation directed
by Dr. Ralph S. Solecki, of the Smithsonian Institution,
turned up yet more material that helps us date the
Neanderthal. In the Zagros Mountains of northern
Iraq, at Shanidar Cave, in Shanidar Valley, there is a
remarkable deposit of both the tools and the bones of
early man. The cave contained a dozen feet or so of
Upper Paleolithic remains overlying a deep Mousterian
deposit. The bottom level of the Upper Paleolithic
materials has been dated at over 34,000 years. How
much older the Mousterian layers may be we cannot
yet be sure. From depths of 14&frac12; and 23 feet below the
surface and within the Mousterian deposit, adult skeletons
<span class="pb" id="Page_97">97</span>
have been recovered. These seem to be Neanderthaloid,
as does the skeleton of a child, recovered at
a depth of 26 feet. The estimate is that the shallower
of the skeletons may be about 45,000 years old, the
lower adult perhaps 60,000.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_21" href="#fn_5_21">[21]</a></p>
<h3>Homo sapiens&mdash;<i>New or Old?</i></h3>
<p>The relationship of all
these forms of early man is much disputed. For many,
many years they were all supposed to be barren offshoots
of our ancestral tree. Nobody could find the particular
breed of ape-man from which we were descended.
Now science is inclined to lump most of them
together in one way or another. There are many theories
and many genealogies. Swanscombe man plays
grandfather to <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Java man and Peking
man become the forebears of the Mongoloid. Other
men from Java father the Australian, and even the Neanderthal.
The Neanderthals breed out their crudeness
in some sort of union with <i>Homo sapiens</i>. Or all of them
are admitted to the ranks of Homo, with Neanderthal
a degenerate offshoot without issue.</p>
<p>The earlier picture was simpler and more dramatic.
From <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> to <i>Homo neanderthalensis</i>&mdash;Java
man to the Neanderthal&mdash;these creatures
bore no relation to our own happy breed. Then, quite
suddenly, came <i>Homo sapiens</i> in the person of the Cro-Magnon.
He was the kind of tall fellow with a well
domed, narrow Nordic head whom Hitler identified
with the better class of human beings. Except for the
&ldquo;Red Lady of Paviland,&rdquo; the first specimens were found
at Aurignac, France, in 1852, though nobody recognized
the outstanding quality of the skulls until the
find at Cro-Magnon, France, in 1868 (see illustration,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_89">page 89</a>).</p>

1915.)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>For many years the French clung to what Hooton
calls the rather chauvinistic myth that here, in the
waning years of the Great Ice Age, we find a superior
kind of man that was predominantly a product of the
French area. Certainly he was a remarkable person in
many ways. For one thing, he discovered art. He
painted on the walls of his caves and carved on pieces
of bone and elephant ivory pictures of mammoths,
bison, and boars, and he made sculptures of fat
women in stone. Also, he began to fish in the swift
streams that ran off from the glaciers. He hunted reindeer
and made use of their antlers as tools. For quite a
time he was supposed to represent the peak of achievement
by early man.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i021a.jpg" alt="Timeline" width="600" height="153" />
</div>
<p>Before long, however, the Cro-Magnon became only
a factor in a broader culture, described as the Aurignacian,
and soon the Aurignacian suffered from scientific
fission. Through this whole period and, indeed, until
the end of the Old Stone Age, new tools in the form of
blades, chisellike burins, and implements of reindeer
bone make their appearance; but they vary in shape
and in the time of their emergence. Some of these tools
divide what was formerly called the Aurignacian into
three parts: the Ch&acirc;telperron, the Middle Aurignacian,
and the Gravettian. The Ch&acirc;telperron people developed
a narrow, curved blade out of a tool vaguely
Mousterian. The Middle Aurignacians appeared as invaders
with thin blades and scrapers notched or narrowed
halfway along each side. Finally, a people who
had hunted mammoths in southern Russia&mdash;the Gravettians&mdash;turned
<span class="pb" id="Page_100">100</span>
up in France as the inventors of a thin,
narrow, and straight blade made by carefully detaching
sliver after sliver from a well shaped core of flint.
Sometimes one edge was blunted to make it handier to
use; occasionally the point of a blade or other tool was
chipped off diagonally to produce a chisellike engraving
tool. Another type of tool, the Font Robert point
with a stem, also appeared (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_101">page 101</a>).</p>

advent of the Aurignacians at about 27,000 years ago,
Nelson at 20,000, Mather at 15,000.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_22" href="#fn_5_22">[22]</a> Zeuner, however,

75,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_23" href="#fn_5_23">[23]</a> Dating the last of the glaciers was
the key to this dispute. Radiocarbon dates now suggest
that the Aurignacian period survived in Europe and
the Near East until 18,000 to 34,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_24" href="#fn_5_24">[24]</a> Its
beginnings may well extend beyond the range of this
method.</p>

<p>The Aurignacians are a variegated lot, which argues
further for subdividing them. One specimen, the tall,
high-domed Cro-Magnon, is variously credited with
producing the modern European man, the Eskimo,
and even the Indian of America. Another specimen,
the Grimaldi from the Riviera, is distinctly Negroid.
Another&mdash;from hints in several places&mdash;seems to be
Mongoloid. Apparently, the Aurignacians were almost
variegated enough to have peopled the modern world.
But almost as much could be said for the inhabitants
of an upper level in the Choukoutien Cave near Peking.
There, in one spot, they divide nicely into Negroid,
Eskimoid, and Melanesoid.</p>
<h3>Solutrean Flint Workers Invade Europe</h3>
<p>Toward the
close of Aurignacian times comes a remarkable people
called the Solutreans. They appear quite suddenly as
invading hunters, and they disappear as suddenly.
Their culture does not evolve out of the Aurignacian,
and it does not evolve into the next culture, the Magdalenian.
The Solutreans stayed a relatively short time
in Europe; Braidwood once gave them 10,000 years,
but Mather and Peake and Fleure only 500.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_25" href="#fn_5_25">[25]</a> Guesses
as to when they arrived vary as widely. Peake and
Fleure think it was about 12,000 years ago, while
Zeuner puts them back to 67,000 years before our
time.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_26" href="#fn_5_26">[26]</a> Radiocarbon dates indicate only 18,000 years
ago.</p>

<p class="caption">THE MEANING OF SCRAPERS</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>&ldquo;A primitive thing called a scraper is crude and not at
all eloquent until you realize that it points to much else.
It means not only a scraper, but a thing to be scraped,
most likely a hide; therefore it means a growing ability to
kill, to take off the hide and cure it. That is just the beginning,
for a scraper also shows a knowledge of how to scrape,
and a desire for scraping, and enough leisure (beyond the
struggle to get food) to allow time for scraping. All this
means self-restraint and thought for the future, and it implies
a certain confidence in the ways of life, because no
one would be liable to go to all the trouble of scraping if
he did not have reasonable hope of enjoying the results of
the work.&rdquo;&mdash;George R. Stewart, in</i> Man: An Autobiography.

Leakey, 1935.</i>)</p>

<p>Where the Solutreans came from is another of the
unsolved riddles of archaeology. Until recently, they
were generally supposed to have come out of western
Asia, because the most primitive of their remarkable
tools were found plentifully in Hungary and sparsely
in western Europe. For sixty years Solutrean points
were found no farther south than northern and eastern
Spain. Now, however, points of Solutrean type have
begun to appear in North Africa, Egypt, and Kenya
Colony. Here they are jumbled together in the same
strata with Mousterian points and the tanged points of
the Aterians, a purely African people. Hence certain
archaeologists are inclined to believe that the Solutreans
may have originated in Africa as an offshoot of
the Mousterians (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_105">page 105</a>).</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/i024.jpg" alt="Timeline" width="600" height="152" />
</div>
<p>In spite of their fondness for the chase, the Solutreans
of Europe continued the interest that the Aurignacians
had shown in art&mdash;or so at least certain authorities
who admire the relief carvings of Le Roc in France
tell us. But their chief distinction is that they knew the
craft of pressure flaking typical of Folsom and Eden
cultures in the New World. The Solutreans are represented
mainly by thin, willow- or laurel-shaped tools.
By pressing&mdash;not pounding&mdash;a piece of bone or wood
against the surface of the flint they flaked off slivers
across the tool in a way that no one equaled in the
Old World until the Egyptians had entered the neolithic
and agricultural age many thousands of years
later. The Solutreans also made small points with a
tang at one side (see illustrations, pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_105">105</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_165">165</a>).
This was for the purpose of fastening the flint
to a shaft; but whether it was used with a bow or
a spear-thrower is not clear. (Incidentally, points of
somewhat this shape appear in the New World.) At
about the same time, the Aterians of North Africa used
a very crude tanged arrowhead; and in the late Aurignacian
the Font Robert point with its rude tang appeared.
The superior spear point of the Solutreans
seems the natural product of a people who were particularly
active and energetic in the chase. In a single
camping place they left 35,000 tools of flint.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>It was only in the late years of the Old Stone Age that
man learned to put a tang on a point and so make it easier
to fasten to a shaft. This advance may have been made in
connection with the spear-thrower, but it seems more likely
that the arrow brought forth this technological refinement.
Only Solutrean man and the American Paleo-Indian made
truly efficient points. (The Solutrean, after Burkitt, 1933;

</div>
<p>Following these Asiatics, a people whose culture was
very similar to that of the Aurignacians appeared in
Europe. They were the Magdalenians, and they carried
on the general traits of the men of Aurignac and
added to them (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_101">page 101</a>). They made
better blades and burins. (Long, slim blades of the
Aurignacian-Magdalenian type have been found in
Mexico, and there are burins in Alaska and northern
Asia.) The burins helped the Magdalenians to make
new implements of bone such as needles, fishhooks,
harpoons, and spear-throwers. Besides all this, they
brought to perfection the arts of painting and sculpture
which used to be too much credited to the Aurignacians
(see illustrations, pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_110">110</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_114">114</a>). The magnificent
<span class="pb" id="Page_108">108</span>
polychromes of the Magdalenians in the Lascaux
and Font-de-Gaume Caves in France and the
Altamira Cave in Spain testify to the genius of this people.
The customary dispute exists about their time of
activity. One authority puts it from 11,500 to 8,500
years ago, and another from 70,000 to 25,000.<a class="fn" id="fr_5_27" href="#fn_5_27">[27]</a> Radiocarbon

<h3>Weapons and Tools&mdash;from Hand Ax to Arrowhead</h3>
<p>One of the many mysteries of prehistory is who invented
the bow and arrow. The smaller Solutrean
points argue that their makers used a bow and invented
this primitive but effective machine. But since
the bow was made of wood, it has not been preserved
in the caves and terraces that spared the bone spear-throwers
of the Magdalenians and the flint projectiles;
so for evidence we must fall back on the paintings of
primitive man. We find the spear-thrower portrayed in
South Africa but not in Europe. The newer weapon,
the bow, is on the walls of rock shelters in southern and
eastern Spain. At first these paintings were thought to
be neolithic. Later they were credited to the Magdalenians,
in spite of the fact that the use of the human
form and the bizarre and almost humorous caricature
contrast with the subjects and the style of Magdalenian
art. Now they are generally credited to the Capsians, a
people from northern Africa. The paintings resemble
prehistoric work from Rhodesia and the Tassili Mountains
of southern Algeria, and also the historic and protohistoric
designs of the Bushmen (see illustrations,
pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_111">111</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_112">112</a>).</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>Although prehistoric engravings of animal figures on bone
had been discovered in European caves as early as about
1840, and engravings on cave walls in the sixties, it was
not till 1878 that paintings were found. The discoverer
was a child. While Marcelino de Sautuola was searching
among the debris on the floor of the cave of Altamira, near
Santander, in Spain, he heard his little daughter cry</i>
&ldquo;Toros! Toros!&rdquo; <i>and saw her point to polychrome paintings
of bison and other animals on the roof of the cave. One of
them appears at the top of this page. The other painting
shown is from the French cave of Font-de-Gaume. These
two caverns contain the finest lineal art of early man, chiefly
Magdalenian. (The bison after Cartailhac and Breuil,
1906; the deer after Capitan, Breuil, and Peyroni, 1910.)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>The history of even the simplest of man&rsquo;s tools from
the hand ax to the arrowhead is long, interesting, and
puzzling. It is hard to say what many of the tools were
used for, or indeed what they were <i>not</i> used for. The
hand ax would obviously be best for grubbing out roots
and tubers, yet, like most of the implements of early
man, it must have served a variety of other purposes
also. Until the Mousterians began to make spear points,
90,000 to 150,000 years ago, all man&rsquo;s implements&mdash;even
what we call his scrapers&mdash;were pretty generalized.
Later, with the Aurignacians and the Magdalenians,
came artifacts that were obviously blades or
knives or chisels or harpoons. The tool to make other
tools appeared, and this we must add to the list of
man&rsquo;s prehistoric achievements: speech, fire making,
stone chipping, pressure flaking, and carving and
painting.</p>
<p>The attempt of science to record and interpret the
story of early man in the Old World has been an extraordinary
triumph over the obstacles of half a million
years of prehistoric darkness. Hundreds of men and
women, laboring long and ingeniously, have won to an
almost miraculous success, and the end is not yet in
sight.</p>
<p>The work has suffered, of course, from many a human
limitation. Not the least of these has been the
desire to interpret knowledge too quickly, to freeze it
<span class="pb" id="Page_112">112</span>
into forms and classifications, and to stand doggedly
by those forms and classifications when they have become
weakened by new knowledge. The student and
the intelligent layman have been confused by all this.
They have been particularly confused&mdash;as we think we
can show&mdash;when it comes to early man in the New
World.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>Aurignacian and Magdalenian men of France drew and

Africa in the Aurignacian period and spread into Europe at
some time between then and the Neolithic. The style resembles

<h3>The Danger in Universal Time-Scales</h3>
<p>When we apply
to the paleolithic cultures of the rest of the world
the names of the European culture sequence&mdash;Abbevillian,
Acheulean, Mousterian, Aurignacian, Solutrean,
<span class="pb" id="Page_113">113</span>
Magdalenian&mdash;we produce acrimonious argument and
not much more. These terms are of no use in the rest
of the world except as a description of types of tools. In
parts of Africa, for example, Mousterian and Aurignacian
objects are found together; in other parts, Mousterian
and Solutrean. In the first case, the Aurignacian
includes primitive pottery; in the second, Aurignacian
is missing altogether.</p>

<p>Tied in with the mistake of setting up prehistory in
Europe as a frame for prehistory elsewhere, lies the
worse mistake of trying to read general time in terms
of things and ideas which are purely local. The Paleolithic,
Neolithic, Bronze, and Stone Ages mean less
than nothing as a dating machine for more than a single
locality. &ldquo;The Stone Age,&rdquo; says Childe, &ldquo;ended before
3500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> in Mesopotamia, about 1600 <span class="small">B.C.</span> in Denmark,
and <span class="small">A.D.</span> 1800 in New Zealand.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_28" href="#fn_5_28">[28]</a> Postglacial
means one thing in Germany and another in Sweden,
one thing in Buffalo and another in Winnipeg.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>The impossibility of measuring time and space together
should be clear enough if you consider merely
the matter of how the invention of writing in the
Near East is related to written records in other parts
of the world. Again we quote Childe: &ldquo;In England they
take us back to <span class="small">A.D.</span> 40, in France to 60 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, in Italy a
little beyond 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, in Greece before 700, but nowhere
in our continent before 1000. In China written
records are available as early as 1400 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, in Asia Minor
to 1800, only in Egypt and Mesopotamia to 3000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_5_29" href="#fn_5_29">[29]</a>
Thus the use of writing would give us no time scale
for the Old World. Fortunately, we have never tried
to date the history of nations in terms of an Illiterate
Age, a Writing Age, and a Printing Age.</p>
<p>There is similar difficulty over the fossils of extinct
mammals which help to date man in Europe. They do
fairly well as an index to whether a tool was used in a
glacial or an interglacial period. But they sometimes
create scientific disagreements when they are used to
place the tool in one glacial period or another. And
when we reach the crucial time of the end of the last
glaciation, and the extinction of the last great beasts,
we are in most serious trouble. Here we are dealing
with tens of thousands of years instead of hundreds of
thousands, and the evidence is simply not that sharp.
We do not know when Magdalenian man saw and
painted his last mammoth. The mammoths died by
inches&mdash;or by miles, geographically speaking. They
were still alive in one area when they had died out in
another. And when we reach the New World, we have
still less basis for setting our watches by the fossils&mdash;as
will be seen in a later chapter.</p>

<span class="lr">&mdash;<span class="small">EZEKIEL</span> 37:4</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Early Man as Adam&rsquo;s Progeny</h3>
<p>Early man is only
about a century old&mdash;in the New World as well as the
Old. While a Frenchman theorized about hand axes
and the river terraces of the Somme, a German discovered
in Missouri the bones of a mastodon which
had been stoned and burned by man. That was 1838.
Within twenty years early man had won his title to
glacial antiquity in Europe. It took ninety, however,
for him to get a really sound and solid claim to even
10,000 years in our hemisphere. The study of early man
in the Americas has suffered from blindness and prejudice
and also from ardor and infatuation. It has run
afoul of the dogmatism of science quite as much as the
dogmatism of religion.</p>
<p>Before nineteenth century science began to talk of
glacial man as a possible and provable fact, there was
little or no churchly antagonism. The religious had long
shown a fondness for what they called antiquarianism.
To find ancient things did no violence to the Bible.
Adam was still the first man, and any descendant of
his who left stone tools about or who carved mysterious
signs on rocks was merely &ldquo;antediluvian&rdquo;: he had
simply missed the boat. In 1690 the Reverend Cotton
<span class="pb" id="Page_120">120</span>
Mather called the carvings on Dighton Rock in Massachusetts
&ldquo;the wonderful works of God,&rdquo; and, before
those signs were proved to be of sixteenth century
origin, more than 600 books and articles had been written
about them. To Mather the fossils of extinct mammals
proved the validity of the Bible. &ldquo;There were
giants in the earth in those days.&rdquo; In 1712 he described
the &ldquo;17-foot thighbone&rdquo; and the four-pound tooth of a
mastodon.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_1" href="#fn_6_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>In this spirit of sweet reasonableness the pursuit of
early man went forward for one hundred and fifty
years. When the Dutch traveler Peter Kalm wrote in
1772 of certain curious discoveries in New Jersey, he
had no idea that he had come on something which,
N. C. Nelson was to declare, &ldquo;hinted strongly of &lsquo;Quaternary
age.&rsquo;&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_2" href="#fn_6_2">[2]</a> Though the Mound Builders seemed
much more ancient to General Rufus Putnam than
they now seem to us, they were still post-Adamites
when he mapped the prehistoric earthworks of Marietta,
Ohio, in 1788. We doubt that Thomas Jefferson
worried one way or the other about biblical sanction
when he assumed the role of first archaeologist of
America by excavating a Virginia mound in 1784, and
reporting on it in his <i>Notes on Virginia</i>. Like another
deist, Voltaire, he suggested that the origins of the
American Indians might be determined by comparing
their various languages with the languages of Asiatic
peoples.</p>
<p>There was still no conflict between religion and the
science of man when word came from Missouri in 1838
of the first linking of the fossils of extinct animals with
signs of human activity. &ldquo;Dr.&rdquo; A. C. Koch, a German
who collected fossils and sold them to museums, dug
up the bones of a mastodon. Further, Koch found evidence
of fire among the bones, and also numerous
stones which seemed to have been carried to the spot
and thrown at the unhappy animal as it stood bogged
<span class="pb" id="Page_121">121</span>
in a swamp. Two years later, in the same state, Koch
came upon another mastodon as well as a spear point
lying beneath it. From a chain of descriptions of the
weapon it may be that Koch found the first of those
unique fluted spear points that were to turn up ninety
years later among the fossils of extinct bison and mammoths.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_3" href="#fn_6_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>While Koch was circusing his mastodon up and
down the country as the &ldquo;Missourium,&rdquo; the first scientific
paper appeared on a New World find of human
skulls and the fossils of extinct animals. This was the
1842 report of the Danish naturalist P. W. Lund on
the Lagoa Santa caves of Brazil.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_4" href="#fn_6_4">[4]</a> Four years later M.
W. Dickeson reported a petrified human pelvis from
Natchez, Mississippi; in 1849 the British scientist Sir
Charles Lyell described his visit to the spot, and in
1863 he pointed out that the pelvis was quite as fossilized
as some mammoth bones that had been found
near it.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_5" href="#fn_6_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Neither of these finds aroused any more enthusiasm
or controversy than Koch&rsquo;s. It was all very curious and
interesting but perfectly acceptable. There was no
question of the men and the elephants being particularly
ancient&mdash;just antediluvian. Agassiz&rsquo;s glacial hypothesis
was hardly known, and Darwin had not yet
turned back time past the Garden of Eden. Adam and
the Bible were safe enough.</p>
<h3>Science and Religion Embattled</h3>
<p>But by the time the
next few finds began to be discussed, the spiritual and
intellectual climate had changed. A wind off the
glaciers chilled the enthusiasm of the churchly, and
banished bland talk of &ldquo;antediluvian antiquities.&rdquo;
Agassiz and Darwin and early man had to go down together
or triumph at the expense of Genesis. The issue
was joined. The churchman grew bitter and blind; the
scientist, ardent and uncritical.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<p>Of the many conflicts and controversies, the most
celebrated raged around the Calaveras skull. Except
for the fact that in this case the churchmen seem to
have been right and the scientists wrong, it was characteristic
of most of the disputes over early man. Fittingly
enough, the skull was found in the California
county which Mark Twain made famous about the
same time by his own discovery of the celebrated
jumping frog. There is no question that a mine operator
with a reputation for veracity far superior to Mark
Twain&rsquo;s Truthful James found the thing in a shaft 130
feet below the surface. There is also no question that
the skull, with its heavy brow ridges, was fossilized
and encrusted with the kind of gravel that distinguishes
California mines. Unfortunately, the skull
proved too much&mdash;or seemed to. It lay under four strata
of lava and three of gold-bearing gravels, and therefore
belonged at the very least to the Pliocene period which
ended some million years ago&mdash;unless, of course, a practical
joker had salted the mine. Some scientists accepted
the skull. Some preachers and religious editors
were content with evidence from Holy Writ, but most
of them preferred the practical joke argument. Various
wits and various victims were involved, but the most
popular explanation held that the mine operator was
known as an agnostic, and that certain miners thought
it would be amusing to plant faked evidence for him to
embrace&mdash;which presumes a considerable amount of
churchly enthusiasm in the miners of Calaveras
County. Science asked where the miners could have
got so ancient and fossilized a skull, and a few scientists
and a good many Protestants replied that the name
of the county had come from the Spanish word for
skulls <i>calaveras</i> because whole skeletons and &ldquo;uneasy
crania&rdquo; were constantly turning up in its soil and its
river beds.</p>
<p>The controversy raged through the 1870&rsquo;s and gained
<span class="pb" id="Page_123">123</span>
new vigor in 1880, when J. D. Whitney, a leading geologist
of his day and director of the California Geological
Survey, brought out <i>Auriferous Gravels of the Sierra
Nevada of California</i>. In the fourteen years since the
discovery of the skull, Whitney had studied the region
thoroughly and gathered data from everyone who remembered
the circumstances of the find. He concluded
that the skull had been discovered <i>in situ</i>, and
had not been planted. Some twenty-five years later,
when the religious fury of the attacks had subsided,
Ale&#353; Hrdli&#269;ka produced craniums from the caves of
California that were quite as fossilized as the Calaveras
skull and showed the same heavy brow ridges. He had
to admit, however, that the ridges of the Calaveras
skull extended clear across the eyes and nose&mdash;&ldquo;a much
less common form.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_6" href="#fn_6_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>In the days of Queen Victoria scientists were sometimes
as extravagant in their claims for early man in
the Americas as the fundamentalists were absurd in
their attacks upon him. Fiorino Ameghino, a museum
director of Buenos Aires, got a hearing for what he
called evidences of Argentine man in an age when the
mammals had only just reached ascendancy. He made
his initial discovery at nineteen; that was in 1873. For
forty or fifty years he went on making find after find
and raising controversy after controversy. The fossilized
bones of man and mammal that he discovered at
nineteen he placed in the Pliocene Epoch, prior to the
Great Ice Age; geologists claimed that the stratum
where he made his finds is of the Ice Age or later. Much
the same criticism applied to most of Ameghino&rsquo;s discoveries.
He set up four primitive types of early man,
based on the discovery of various bones, and placed
the first in the Miocene Epoch more than fifteen million
years ago. The geologists again put his strata in the
Glacial period. Anthropologists and paleontologists
were quite as annoyed as the geologists when Ameghino
<span class="pb" id="Page_124">124</span>
made Argentina the center from which all
human and mammalian forms spread over the world.</p>
<p>Yet, in spite of Ameghino&rsquo;s extravagant claims and
others that were somewhat less extravagant, belief
in early man persisted and grew. There was considerable
stir when, between 1872 and 1899, C. C. Abbott
and others discovered some primitive stone implements<a class="fn" id="fr_6_7" href="#fn_6_7">[7]</a>
(see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_144">page 144</a>), parts of a human
thigh-bone, jaw, and skull, in glacial gravels near Trenton,
New Jersey. There were more finds at other sites,
and by 1890 it was generally conceded by scientists
that man had invaded the Americas during or close
to the time of the last glaciers. The Protestant church
subsided into a quietude which was not to be broken
until the Scopes &ldquo;monkey trial&rdquo; of 1925.</p>
<h3>Reaction, Led by Science</h3>
<p>In the nineties&mdash;which was
roughly the beginning of more intense and thorough
scientific study in the whole field of American prehistory&mdash;a
reaction set in. Early man and his sponsors
were violently attacked&mdash;not by the church but by certain
scientists. Thomas Wilson, Curator of the National
Museum in Washington, and F. W. Putnam of the Peabody
Museum at Harvard, who had long championed
early man, were furiously set upon by W. H. Holmes,
then of the Field Museum of Chicago, as well as
Hrdli&#269;ka, of the National Museum. Taking advantage
of every error, every failure to weigh evidence with the
most scrupulous care, and using new knowledge in
physical anthropology, Holmes and Hrdli&#269;ka routed
their opponents completely. How completely may be
judged from the fact that when it became proper to
issue the Putnam Anniversary Volume at Putnam&rsquo;s
seventieth birthday, not one of the twenty-five essays
in anthropology dedicated to him dealt with the thesis
of which he had been one of the chief champions&mdash;early
man in the Americas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>Men discovered new sites, but, if they had the temerity
to announce their finds, their work was ignored or
scouted. For twenty-five or thirty years, as Frank H.
H. Roberts, Jr., writes, the subject of early man in the
New World became virtually taboo, and no scientist
desirous of a successful career dared intimate that &ldquo;he
had discovered indications of a respectable antiquity
for the Indian.&rdquo; Opponents of early man had definitely
retarded progress in this field.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_8" href="#fn_6_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>From close to the turn of the century Hrdli&#269;ka was
the leader among these opponents just as he was the
leader among the physical anthropologists of his day
and a man of the greatest ability. For about forty years
he wrote much, and he wrote effectively. His long
series of papers were studded with denials of the antiquity
of man on this continent. Beginning in 1907
with his <i>Skeletal Remains Suggesting or Attributed to
Early Man in North America</i>, he demolished one
American skull after another. He tore to shreds the evidence
by which Ameghino pushed man back millions
of years in Argentina.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_9" href="#fn_6_9">[9]</a> His most effective argument
against North American claims was to produce the
craniums of Mound Builders or even Indians of historic
times which duplicated finds of early man. He stigmatized
skull after skull as &ldquo;not in the least primitive,&rdquo;
&ldquo;essentially modern,&rdquo; &ldquo;not to be distinguished from the
modern Indian.&rdquo; Unfortunately, as he grew older, his
attacks on spurious evidence developed into violent
opposition to practically <i>all</i> evidence. As late as 1942,
he saw his opponents as men characterized by &ldquo;wishful
thinking, imagination, opinionated amateurism,
and desire for self-manifestation.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_10" href="#fn_6_10">[10]</a> He recognized no
prejudice on his own side.</p>
<p>Yet, against the harm that Hrdli&#269;ka did science by
intimidating its students, we must set a practical value
which Earnest A. Hooton&mdash;himself as great a physical
<span class="pb" id="Page_126">126</span>
anthropologist as Hrdli&#269;ka, but a more receptive one
on the subject of early man&mdash;has well expressed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is to the everlasting credit of professional American
anthropology that it has not succumbed to the
itch for ancestors by giving recognition to the many
dubious and spurious finds whose claims have too often
received a facile acceptance abroad. No one can deny
that this salutary state of affairs is due almost entirely
to the righteous scientific iconoclasm of one formidable
veteran, Dr. Hrdli&#269;ka.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_11" href="#fn_6_11">[11]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>The Red Herring of the &ldquo;Primitive Skull&rdquo;</h3>
<p>It was
Hrdli&#269;ka&rsquo;s misfortune&mdash;and the misfortune of science&mdash;that
until almost the end of his life he refused to meet
his opponents on common ground. He was right
enough in challenging early man as an inhabitant of
America 200,000 years ago, but he challenged him in
terms that applied or seemed to apply to any man
earlier than the Indian of three or four thousand years
ago. Hrdli&#269;ka failed to define properly the thing he
was attacking. He merely prated of the lack of &ldquo;primitive
skulls.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was not the issue. Except for Ameghino, scientists
of the twentieth century were not claiming to have
found Abbevillian or even Neanderthal man in the
New World. They were merely saying that certain
skulls and certain tools might go back to the end of
glacial times or perhaps a little earlier. This was no
earlier than the Cro-Magnon of Europe, and the Cro-Magnon
was modern enough in physical type. So were
the skulls found with glacial animals and paleolithic
tools in the upper Choukoutien Cave near Peking. As
Hooton puts it, the glacial antiquity of a New World
skeleton cannot be disproved by &ldquo;the modernity of its
anatomical characters alone. <i>Homo sapiens</i> was full-fledged
in the Old World before the end of the Glacial
Period. Late Glacial entrants into the Americas need
<span class="pb" id="Page_127">127</span>
not prove their age by an array of archaic and simian
physical features. The acid test of their antiquity must
be geological.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_12" href="#fn_6_12">[12]</a> Roberts points out that opponents of
early man in America &ldquo;demand a more primitive physical
type as evidence for some antiquity in the New
World than was living in the Old at a comparable
time.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_13" href="#fn_6_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>As pressure of evidence and opinion piled up in
favor of early man, Hrdli&#269;ka began to weaken a bit.
In 1937 he admitted that, compared with Europe, the
situation in America &ldquo;is not so simple. It is complicated
by the fact ... that individual skulls of recent and
even present-day American aborigines not seldom
show features that are more primitive than the average
in the white races. There are American skulls of recent
date that are practically replicas of the Magdalenian
and even of some of the upper Aurignacian skulls of
the Old World and there are occasional skulls that in
some of their characteristics remind one even of the
Neanderthals.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_14" href="#fn_6_14">[14]</a> In other words, a skull of an early
American man which resembles a skull of a historic
Indian may also resemble the skull of a glacial man of
the Old World.</p>
<p>By 1923&mdash;after the harm had been done&mdash;Hrdli&#269;ka
was willing to concede that migration to the Americas
began &ldquo;somewhere between possibly 10,000 or at most
15,000 years ago and the dawn of the protohistoric
period in the Old World.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_15" href="#fn_6_15">[15]</a> Yet he still clung to his
Indian skull, and wrote in one of his last papers:
&ldquo;There is as yet not a specimen of a skull or bone that
could be accepted as that of any earlier or different being
than the American natives of protohistoric or historic
times.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_16" href="#fn_6_16">[16]</a> Even when a skull had the heavy brow
ridges and the long narrow shape of the Australoid&mdash;and
the Neanderthal&mdash;Hrdli&#269;ka gave no ground. Such
notable examples as the skulls from the Lagoa Santa
caves of Brazil&mdash;which we shall describe later&mdash;were
<span class="pb" id="Page_128">128</span>
merely &ldquo;a peculiarly American variant.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_17" href="#fn_6_17">[17]</a> He got only
so far as granting that American man had a relationship
with the Cro-Magnon and the Magdalenian, but
he hinted at this relationship merely in man&rsquo;s &ldquo;early
Old World ancestry.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_18" href="#fn_6_18">[18]</a></p>
<h3>The Mystery of the Missing Bones</h3>
<p>So far as skeletal
relics are concerned, the friends of early man in the
New World would have been at something of a disadvantage
even if Hrdli&#269;ka had been less vocal and
less violent. Until the edge of the Christian era, physical
evidence is scanty in the Americas. The bones of
early man are few and far between. The mastodons,
elephants, sloths, camels, bison, and horses that once
thronged the plains and plateaus south of the glaciers
have left us a great sufficiency of skulls and teeth, vertebrae
and ribs, leg bones and toe bones, and even
some skin, hair, and feces. We have uncountable skeletons
of small animals that live on today. But the fossil
beds are very short indeed on man, and even the dry
caves help us only a little. In the two continents there
are not more than twenty-five finds of the bones of
early man which must be considered seriously, and
some of these are not a little dubious.</p>
<p>It may seem strange that thousands of spear points,
scrapers, and arrowheads can be identified as the products
of early man while we find so few of the skulls
that held the brains which conceived them. It may
seem stranger still&mdash;unbelievably strange&mdash;that, while
the five- and six-foot skeletons of man have disappeared,
there remain to us in excellent shape the delicate
bones of fox and gopher, even the pack rat. We
may believe, however, that, though the Americas
thronged with animals that had been there for millions
of years, there were relatively few men. Northeast Asia,
from which they had come, was not a place to nurture
great tribes, and to send forth migrants by the hundreds
<span class="pb" id="Page_129">129</span>
of thousands. The first men in America had
to live by hunting and gathering, and hunters and
gatherers do not multiply like agricultural peoples.
Against hundreds of thousands of large animals&mdash;millions
upon millions of small fry&mdash;we can place only some
tens of thousands of men. To find a human skeleton
among such a welter of animal bones would be like
finding a single needle in the combined haystacks of
all the Middle West. Further, did early man leave his
body where we should be likely to find it? If he did not
cremate his dead, then he literally exposed them to the
elements&mdash;whether they lay on a scaffold like the dead
of the Plains Indians or were buried in the earth&mdash;and
the elements did a good job in scattering or hiding
them. A great deal of water has flowed over land-bridges
since the glaciers began to melt, and a great
deal of silt and gravel and loess has spread deep over
river bottoms and even high plateaus, burying the
bones of early man beneath it.</p>
<p>What do we find in the way of human bones? Not
too much, compared with the many skulls and skeletons
of the Neanderthal and Cro-Magnon in Europe.
They range from the top of a cranium or part of a
pelvis to a few complete skeletons, some properly
buried. They are not all of equal value. The best, however,
tell us something about how certain early Americans
may have looked. By that, at least, they contribute
more than the thousands of stone tools which early man
left behind him.</p>
<h3>South America Provides the First Skulls</h3>
<p>So far as anthropology
is concerned, it was a busy and important
decade that ended in 1850. Prescott&rsquo;s histories of the
conquest of Mexico and Peru, and John L. Stephens&rsquo;s
two books of travel and study in the Maya area had
become best-sellers. Lord Kingsborough was publishing
his nine-volume <i>Antiquities of Mexico</i>. Boucher de
<span class="pb" id="Page_130">130</span>
Perthes was finding additional hand axes, and beginning
to write upon them. More important for our purposes
is the report of the Danish naturalist Lund that
he found the skulls of men mingled with the bones of
extinct mammals in the Lagoa Santa caves of Brazil.</p>
<p>It would be pleasant to think that Lund left Europe
in 1835 imbued with enthusiasm for the discoveries
of Boucher de Perthes, but this is highly unlikely. The
Frenchman and his theories were pretty generally ignored
by science until the late fifties. We don&rsquo;t know
why Lund chose to explore caves in the state of Minas
Gerais, north of Rio de Janeiro, but in the end it was a
fortunate choice. He examined over two hundred
caves, and in six of them he found human remains. For
eight or nine years he was dubious about his finds, but
he was convinced in 1844 when he found human bones
mingled with the bones of extinct animals, all equally
fossilized.</p>
<p>Though it was the bones of the mammals that convinced
Lund of the antiquity of the Lagoa Santa craniums,
it is certain peculiarities of the skulls themselves
that have given them a very special importance in the
whole argument for early man in the New World. These
skulls were long and narrow, while those of most Indians
and other Mongoloid peoples are relatively short
and broad. Again in contrast to the men of northern
Asia, the Lagoa Santa had very heavy brow ridges;
their skulls were straight-sided and had keeled vaults.
The total effect was archaic. This was to prove a basic
type to which all the later finds of the bones of early
man could be related.</p>
<p>Dr. Lund&rsquo;s bones were not received with too much
enthusiasm. If they had belonged to any animal other
than man, says Sir Arthur Keith, &ldquo;their antiquity would
never have been questioned, but being human all sorts
of doubts were raised as to how and when they became
mixed with the remains of extinct animals.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_19" href="#fn_6_19">[19]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_131">131</span>
Many years passed before the Lagoa Santa skulls began
to win respectful attention and final acceptance
as other long and narrow skulls with even stronger
brow ridges turned up under similar conditions.</p>
<p>No one worked in the Lagoa Santa regions for almost
a century. In 1933 members of the Academy of
Science of Minas Gerais excavated a neighboring cave
called Confins. They found the molars of a young mastodon
under a few feet of dirt inside the entrance.
Deeper down and farther back, they discovered fossils
of horse, giant sloth, mastodon, and other extinct mammals.
Finally they came on a nearly complete human
skeleton. They had cut through a layer of stalagmitic
material and more than six feet of alluvial soil to reach
the bones of Confins man, and so they knew that he
had died during or just before a period of great moisture.
They write of this time as the Post-Pleistocene, or
Pluvial. Post-Pleistocene means, of course, Postglacial,
and Pluvial means a time of much rain. Some scientists
push the Pluvial back into the Glacial, but the finders
of Confins man prefer to date him at &ldquo;a few thousands
of years ago.&rdquo; The discoverers of the Confins skull write
of it as &ldquo;one of the most primitive types of <i>Homo sapiens</i>
... yet discovered in South America.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_20" href="#fn_6_20">[20]</a> But this
statement seems based more on the conditions under
which it was found than on its shape. The skull is long
and narrow, with heavy brow ridges and a low forehead;
but it is not straight-sided, and its vault is not
keeled. It is somewhat less archaic than the Lagoa
Santa craniums.</p>
<p>Certain skulls from Ecuador seem much more
archaic than any of those found in Brazil. These are
the Punin specimen found in 1923, and the group discovered
at Paltacalo almost twenty years before.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_21" href="#fn_6_21">[21]</a> Associated
with the fossils of extinct horse, camel, and
mastodon, they have all the peculiarities of the Lagoa
<span class="pb" id="Page_132">132</span>
Santa specimens, and in addition they have retreating
foreheads, lower vaults, and unusually large teeth.</p>
<p>Far down in Chile long-headed skulls have been
found in association with fossils of extinct horse and
ground sloth. They are not so extreme in appearance
as the Lagoa Santa skulls, though they resemble them.
As for their age, Junius Bird, who made the discovery
in caves just north of the Strait of Magellan, reckons&mdash;in
what he calls &ldquo;a few degrees better than an outright
guess&rdquo;&mdash;that they belonged to men who were given
cremation burials not more than 5,400 years ago. We
now have radiocarbon dates for such caves from 6,500
to 9,000 years ago. Bird did not venture to guess how
many years it took these people to travel the 11,000
miles from the strait of Vitus Jonasson Bering to the
strait of Ferdinand Magellan.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_22" href="#fn_6_22">[22]</a></p>
<h3>North American Skulls and Bones</h3>
<p>Since the discovery
of human bones in glacial gravels near Trenton,
New Jersey, three skeletons of some importance and a
number of skulls that resemble those of Lagoa Santa
and Punin have been found in the United States.</p>
<p>The three finds of complete skeletons made in Minnesota
between 1931 and 1935 have aroused much debate.
All three were encountered in road-making or
the digging of gravel, and scientists were not present
at their discovery. A. E. Jenks&rsquo;s study of these skeletons
has done much to clarify them.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_23" href="#fn_6_23">[23]</a> &ldquo;Minnesota man&rdquo;&mdash;really
a girl&mdash;was found in a geological stratum marked
by varves, or thin layers of clay, laid down in successive
years by a glacial lake about 11,000 years ago. Antevs
believes her body was thrust into this stratum at a later
time; but other geological authorities, including Kirk
Bryan, Paul MacClintock, G. F. Kay, and M. M. Leighton,
deny it and present rather convincing evidence.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_24" href="#fn_6_24">[24]</a>
Hooton unhesitatingly expresses the opinion that &ldquo;this
discovery establishes a very strong probability, though
<span class="pb" id="Page_133">133</span>
not an absolute certainty, of the existence of <i>Homo
sapiens</i> in the New World in Late Glacial times.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_25" href="#fn_6_25">[25]</a>
Artifacts found with the skeleton&mdash;including part of a
knife made from an antler&mdash;do not give us a radiocarbon
date. In the gravel of Browns Valley, where the
second skeleton was found, there were also spear
points (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_158">page 158</a>). From geological
evidence connected with this find&mdash;the most generally
accepted of the three in Minnesota&mdash;a date between
8,000 and 12,000 years ago seems plausible. The third
skeleton, Sauk Valley man, has been the center of much
dispute. Some geologists believe that the depth of the
occurrence and the presence of a certain sand within
the skull argue a considerable antiquity. Like the
owner of the Punin skull, &ldquo;Minnesota man&rdquo; had a primitive
type of teeth, larger even than those of some Old
World paleolithic specimens. Jenks and L. A. Wilford
find twenty-six archaic traits in the Sauk Valley skull.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_26" href="#fn_6_26">[26]</a></p>
<p>Thousands of years before the elephants and the
men of our three-ring circuses took up winter quarters
in Florida a different kind of elephant and a different
kind of man seem to have come into contact there along
the Indian River. It was a very firm contact indeed;
for, if evidence dug up at Melbourne in 1925 means
anything, it means that a mammoth or a mastodon
stepped on the skull of some variety of early man and
left it flat as a pancake. Other elephants and a goodly
array of mammals that are now extinct left some of
their bones in the same geologic formation with the
skull. Ten years before, other such fossils and an even
more mutilated skull had been found in the same kind
of stratum forty miles away at Vero Beach.</p>
<p>The history of these finds is typical of the disrepute
in which early man was held from 1900 to 1930. A few
men&mdash;E. H. Sellards, who made the Vero find, J. W.
Gidley and F. B. Loomis, who published on both sites,
and some others&mdash;believed the evidence, but &ldquo;that
<span class="pb" id="Page_134">134</span>
doughty doubter&rdquo; Hrdli&#269;ka bore down upon it and left
it as flattened as the Melbourne skull.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_27" href="#fn_6_27">[27]</a> It was only in
1946 through a study by T. D. Stewart, curator of
physical anthropology in the National Museum, that
the finds received a fair estimate as proof of early man
in Florida during glacial or near-glacial time. Besides
upholding the geologic evidence of Sellards, Gidley,
and Loomis, Stewart announced that Hrdli&#269;ka had left
the reconstruction of the Melbourne skull to a minor
technician, and Stewart showed, by a more careful fitting
together of the broken pieces of bone, that the
Melbourne man had the long, narrow, flat-sided head,
the low forehead, and the strong brow ridges typical
of most craniums found under conditions that suggest
antiquity.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_28" href="#fn_6_28">[28]</a> There are no radiocarbon dates, but
fluorine tests&mdash;which tell us whether neighboring materials
are of the same age&mdash;indicate that men saw elephants
at Vero Beach.</p>
<p>Other skulls with the peculiarities of the Melbourne
and South American specimens have been found in the
United States and Mexico. Most of them were fairly
close to the surface in soils of recent types. Only a few
were found in geological formations old enough to be
worth discussion&mdash;the Lansing, Kansas, skull, for instance,
which was buried under twenty feet of loess,
and certain skulls found below hardpan in California&mdash;and
none of these won general acceptance as anywhere
near glacial age. Yet in a number of skulls discovered
in Texas, Lower California, the California coastal area,
and the Sacramento Valley there remains a case for
early man in North America.</p>
<h3>Early Man Not Solely Mongoloid or Indian</h3>
<p>Broadly
speaking, these western craniums, like the other skulls
I have mentioned, are not typically Mongoloid, and
they do not resemble too closely the less Mongoloid
skulls of the long-headed Indians of the Plains and the
<span class="pb" id="Page_135">135</span>
Northeast. Even the freshest and least fossilized specimens&mdash;three
groups from coastal and central Texas&mdash;have
&ldquo;no affinity,&rdquo; according to the physical anthropologists
George and Edna Woodbury, &ldquo;among the tribes
of North America.&rdquo; Instead&mdash;although the brow ridges
are &ldquo;not a conspicuous feature&rdquo;&mdash;they resemble certain
skulls from Lower California called Peric&uacute;, which in
turn resemble the primitive type found in the Lagoa
Santa caves. They were discovered in 1883 by the
Danish anthropologist, C. F. ten Kate.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_29" href="#fn_6_29">[29]</a></p>
<p>Along the coast of California to the north, other narrow
skulls with heavy brow ridges have been found in
the neighborhood of Santa Barbara and the Channel
Islands and from just east of San Francisco to Sacramento.
Some consider the Oak Grove specimens from
Santa Barbara the oldest, but until 1946 most anthropologists
were not inclined to give any of them more
than 4,000 years. Now, however, nine skeletons have
been found near Concord which will probably move
all the California skulls of this type a few thousand
years farther back. These skulls, from what is called
the Monument Site, were under four feet of earth
which the soil experts of the neighboring University of
California believe took anywhere from 4,000 to 8,000
years to accumulate and weather.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_30" href="#fn_6_30">[30]</a> Through shell
ornaments in the burials, Robert F. Heizer identifies
the Monument skulls with what is called the Middle
Central California culture found near the capital of the
state.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_31" href="#fn_6_31">[31]</a> This culture lay above Early Central California,
and the skulls of the latter were found in and beneath
four feet of cementlike hardpan.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_32" href="#fn_6_32">[32]</a> Heizer estimates
the age of these early men &ldquo;in the neighborhood
of 4,000 to 5,000 years,&rdquo; but he states that &ldquo;a number
of soil chemists, geomorphologists, and geologists who
have seen our Early horizon sites have suggested an
antiquity in the neighborhood of 10,000 years.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_33" href="#fn_6_33">[33]</a> The
Monument Site seems to argue that the latter figure is
<span class="pb" id="Page_136">136</span>
not impossible. Even this date gives us no glacial age
for early man in California, but here again we have
skulls that are older and more archaic in type than
those of the Mongoloid Indian. They have some features
of the skulls from Florida and South America that
have been found with the fossils of extinct mammals.</p>
<p>In 1949 Heizer unearthed, not a skull, but the record
of a skull that had been found in 1922 embedded in
four to five feet of gravel now considered &ldquo;early
Recent.&rdquo; The gravel and sixteen or twenty feet of silt
above it formed the bank of a creek near Stanford University.
The skull is long and narrow,<a class="fn" id="fr_6_34" href="#fn_6_34">[34]</a> and is fossilized
enough to suggest a respectable antiquity.</p>
<p>The year 1947 presented us, at last, with an early
skull that seemed as if it could be dated pretty accurately
without the aid of elephants. Yet without their
aid it might never have been found.</p>
<h3>Evidence from Middle America</h3>
<p>Travelers have long
reported bones of mammoths and mastodons in Mexico.
The first to do this was Cort&eacute;s&rsquo;s young lieutenant,
Bernal D&iacute;az. To be sure, he thought that the bone the
Tlascalans showed him belonged to one of their gigantic
ancestors, as they said it did. In his book, <i>The True
History of the Conquest of New Spain</i>, he wrote: &ldquo;So
that we could see how huge and tall these people had
been they brought a leg bone of one of them which was
very thick and the height of a man of ordinary stature,
and that was the bone from the hip to the knee.&rdquo; If we
try to visualize Cort&eacute;s and D&iacute;az inspecting this mammoth
bone, the scene adds, if possible, to the extraordinary
picture that the conquest presents. &ldquo;I measured
myself against it and it was as tall as I am although I
am of fair size.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_35" href="#fn_6_35">[35]</a> Since the days of Cort&eacute;s more and
more fossils of elephants have been found south of the
border. Indeed they crop out of eroded arroyos, drainage
<span class="pb" id="Page_137">137</span>
ditches, and old lake beds only a few miles from
Mexico City itself.</p>
<p>Until November, 1945, little had been done to place
early man in Mexico or to link him with its many fossils.
Then Helmut de Terra&mdash;who had worked long in
eastern and southeastern Asia&mdash;went to the Valley of
Mexico to study the glacial moraines on neighboring
mountains, and to link them with the soils of the old
lake beds in which fossils had long been found. Expanding
the work of A. R. Arellano and Kirk Bryan, he
established the fact that a certain layer of caliche, or
soft, earthy limestone, had been laid down upon the
shrunken shores of Lake Texcoco after the glacial ice
had retreated up Popocatepetl and other mountains.
Under the caliche&mdash;which he dates as beginning to form
between 9,000 and 11,000 years ago&mdash;he found a wet,
silty clay which contained, here and there, the bones of
elephants and a few rudimentary tools of stone and
bone. Then in February, 1947, he decided to hunt for
larger objects in an area near Tepexpan with an electrical
device used for detecting valuable metals and
military mines but never previously used for archaeological
purposes. The resistance of a certain section of
the clay to the passage of an electrical current between
two metal stakes driven into the ground told him that a
foreign body lay a little below the surface. He dug,
and unearthed a skull and a considerable part of the
skeleton of a man who was probably hunting an elephant
or running from one when he became mired in
the bog of the lake shore.</p>
<p>Because of the lake sediment in which de Terra
found the bones, he dates Tepexpan man between 11,000
and 12,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_36" href="#fn_6_36">[36]</a> Another anthropologist,
Glenn H. Black&mdash;basing his opinion on published
photographs of the excavation&mdash;has suggested the &ldquo;possibility,
even probability&rdquo; that Tepexpan man got into
old lake sediment through &ldquo;intrusive burial,&rdquo; which
<span class="pb" id="Page_138">138</span>
means that he was interred by his fellows at a much
later date.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_37" href="#fn_6_37">[37]</a></p>
<p>The skull of this very meaningful man is not so long
and narrow as the other early craniums but not so
round as most Indians&rsquo;. Weidenreich, an outstanding
authority on Java man and his Peking cousin-once-removed,
has found eight features of the Tepexpan skull
and bones &ldquo;which are more primitive than those usually
found in modern human skulls.&rdquo; The brow ridges are
very heavy and form a well marked torus, or bulge,
above the nose, &ldquo;such as occurs in the Australian bushman
of today and in other &lsquo;primitive races.&rsquo;&rdquo; A ridge on
the back of the head &ldquo;resembles even the condition
found in Neanderthal skulls.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_38" href="#fn_6_38">[38]</a> Javier Romero and
T. D. Stewart, however, do not agree with Weidenreich&rsquo;s
analysis. Romero finds the brow ridge &ldquo;not very
markedly developed.&rdquo; Stewart calls it &ldquo;predominantly
Indian in character.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_6_39" href="#fn_6_39">[39]</a></p>
<p>Radiocarbon dates based upon peat and wood
found some distance from the bones of Tepexpan man,
but apparently in the same layer, suggest that the
layer was formed between 11,000 and 16,000 years ago.
These bones and those of extinct animals found nearby
are about equally fossilized&mdash;much more so than the remains
of more recent burials in the same area. Still,
the methods of excavation used here have been criticized,
leaving considerable doubt as to the manner in
which Tepexpan man came to his resting place.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_40" href="#fn_6_40">[40]</a></p>
<p>Other remains of ancient Mexicans include a jaw
from Xico, Pe&ntilde;&oacute;n man&mdash;a heavily mineralized cranium
from Pe&ntilde;&oacute;n de los Ba&ntilde;os, near Mexico City&mdash;and
human bones in similar condition from Iztl&aacute;n, in the
state of Michoac&aacute;n. The layers in which these were
found tell us little geologically. In the case of the
Pe&ntilde;&oacute;n and Iztl&aacute;n finds, claims for antiquity have been
based on the fact that they are heavily mineralized,
but this may have been due to a century or less of
<span class="pb" id="Page_139">139</span>
contact with thermal mineral waters in their neighborhood.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_41" href="#fn_6_41">[41]</a></p>
<h3>New Finds in the United States</h3>
<p>The first wholly acceptable
association of human remains, ancient artifacts,
and extinct animals was found in 1953. On the
Scharbauer Ranch, near Midland, Texas, parts of a
skeleton of a 30-year-old woman were recovered from
a deposit of gray sand that included chipped stone
tools, remains of extinct horse and bison, and the
burned bone of an extinct antelope that Midland
man may accidentally have dug up from a lower layer.
The gray sand provided a number of materials that
have produced dates by radiocarbon and other methods.
A higher and younger layer of red sand contained
artifacts known elsewhere to have a maximum age of
about 10,000 years. This sand was laid down in a different,
more humid climate. Snail shells from a layer
of white sand, below the gray, produced a radiocarbon
date of less than 15,000 years. Logically, Midland man
should date between these extremes. But pieces of
caliche rock from the gray layer, burned presumably
in cooking fires of Midland man, provided a radiocarbon
date of about 20,000 years. This was not acceptable,
since a lower deposit seemed to be younger.
There are at least two potential sources of natural dilution
of radiocarbon that could help the burned caliche
to test older than it actually was.</p>
<p>Tenuous support for the 20,000-year date came from
a new source. Three samples from the gray sand were
submitted for testing by a new approach to dating archaeological
materials&mdash;a refinement of the &ldquo;uranium-clock&rdquo;
technique by which very old rocks are dated.
This, the so-called Rosholt method, is a measurement
of the amounts of uranium and its products in radioactive
disintegration that accumulate in bone or other
material. A ratio is determined between two isotopes
<span class="pb" id="Page_140">140</span>
of uranium (U&sup2;&sup3;&#8312; and U&sup2;&sup3;&#8309;) and such radioactive
related products as protactinium (Pa&sup2;&sup3;&sup1;), thorium
(Th&sup2;&sup3;&#8304;), and radium (Ra&sup2;&sup2;&#8310;). The method is yet unproved
and may have more sources of contamination
or error than radiocarbon. The results of Rosholt measurement
on Midland samples averaged 17,000, 18,000,
and 20,000 years. The latter date was from a small
section of the Midland skull itself. It must be reemphasized
that this process is not established well
enough, and the results here are not acceptable to the
archaeologists who conducted the excavations.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_42" href="#fn_6_42">[42]</a></p>
<p>Radiocarbon dates that can be referred to Midland
man and that are at the same time in keeping with
local geology and paleontology and with regional archaeological
perspectives indicate a probable age of
perhaps 11,000 years.</p>
<p>Other Americans, not so early, are represented by
the skeletal remains of an infant and three adults found
in 1955 at Turin, Iowa. Parts of one adult skeleton and
that of the infant were recovered by experts, under
carefully controlled conditions, from a depth of about
15 feet. The adult had been partially exposed along
the bank of a gravel pit. The associated gravels contained
loess, a wind-blown deposit, indicating a cool
climate and probable antiquity. The Turin skeletons
have been dated in a roundabout manner. A projectile
point associated with the infant bones seems identical
with others found near Quimby, Iowa, with a radiocarbon
date of just under 9,000 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_6_43" href="#fn_6_43">[43]</a></p>
<p>The physical remains of early man in the New
World, no matter what primitive features they may
display, must be considered essentially modern, clearly
of the same species as ourselves. Our best clue to racial
difference is the extreme longheadedness of the earlier
types. Their skulls tend to differ from those of most
modern Indians. Yet we can at least consider the possibility
<span class="pb" id="Page_141">141</span>
that they represented a racial type in contrast
to that of the tribes most recently arrived from Asia.</p>
<p>The old skulls of the New World may not be
entirely satisfactory proofs of the antiquity of early
man in this hemisphere; for Tepexpan man and Minnesota
man both have been challenged as intruders in
an older soil. On the other hand, all the skulls except
perhaps Tepexpan suggest to the partisans of glacial
man in the Americas that the first immigrants were
not &ldquo;predominantly Indian in character.&rdquo; They make
an interesting and significant point. Can it be a mere
coincidence that when we find a head which has been
stepped on by an elephant, it is not round like most
Indians&rsquo;, but longer or narrower, and it has very heavy
brow ridges? Can it be a coincidence that when we
find a skull in a cave with the bones of extinct mammals,
it has those same peculiarities? Can it be a coincidence
that when we find a skull under rocklike hardpan
or a distinctly ancient layer of soil, it has those
unusual stigmata? It does no good to hunt up the skull
of a Sioux or a Mound Builder or an Algonquin which
looks like one from Punin or Florida or Lower California.
That is not much better than finding the skull
of a modern New Yorker that looks like one of early
man&rsquo;s&mdash;which you could do without too much trouble.
If <i>all</i> Sioux skulls or Mound Builder skulls or Algonquin
skulls were as archaic as <i>all</i> the Punin and Florida and
Peric&uacute; skulls, or if some early skulls were short and
broad, then the case for the Mongoloid Indian as the
earliest man in America would be incontestable. But
until we find a round-headed, thoroughly modern
Mongoloid skull that has been stepped on by an elephant
or got itself interred with a mammoth or buried
under earth that ought not to be on top of it, we
shall have to believe that the simon-pure Indian of
Hrdli&#269;ka&rsquo;s idolatry was not the first American. We
<span class="pb" id="Page_142">142</span>
shall have to think that the archaic fellow from Punin
or Florida or Lower California or the Lagoa Santa
caves was our earliest man&mdash;and quite early at that.
Just how early, the bones do not yet say.</p>

<h3>Artifacts from Heaven</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Thunderbolts of God&rdquo;&mdash;from
England to Japan and from Norway to Africa, that was
how men once explained the stone axes and arrowheads
which they found buried in the earth. The philosophers
and scientists of the Renaissance dug a little
deeper, and one of them came up with the verbose and
remarkable suggestion that these stones were made
&ldquo;by an admixture of a certain exhalation of thunder
and lightning with metallic matter, chiefly in dark
clouds, which is coagulated by the circumfused moisture
and conglutinated into a mass (like flour with
water), and subsequently indurated by heat, like a
brick.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_1" href="#fn_7_1">[1]</a> Some found a simpler explanation: these artifacts
were iron tools petrified by time. Toward the end
of the sixteenth century, Michele Mercati, physician to
Pope Clement VIII, saw the truth: &ldquo;They have been
broken off from hard flints by a violent blow, in the
days before iron was employed for the follies of war;
for the earliest men had only splinters of flint for
knives.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_2" href="#fn_7_2">[2]</a> The English historian William Dugdale said
much the same thing in <i>Antiquities of Warwickshire</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_144">144</span>
The theory was not generally accepted, however, until
the Spaniards found American Indians making arrowheads
and stone axes without the aid of thunder, lightning,
or God.</p>
<h3>The Folsom Point&mdash;Unique and Potent</h3>
<p>Quite a different
thunderbolt&mdash;and a potent one&mdash;was the spear point
that J. D. Figgins, of the Denver Museum of Natural
History, found in 1927 between the ribs of an extinct
bison near Folsom, New Mexico. It was a thunderbolt
that destroyed, startlingly and for all time, thirty years
of opposition to the presence of early man in the
Americas.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig45">

<p class="pcapc"><i>A spear point, or possibly a scraper, found near Trenton,
New Jersey, in 1872. Except for lack of retouching on the
edges, it resembles the Mousterian point on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_90">page 90</a>, but
it is a little longer&mdash;5&frac34; inches. This implement was found
on the surface, but it was said to be identical with some
discovered with human bones in the glacial gravel beds below.
(After Abbott, 1872.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>This was not the first discovery of a point with the
peculiar &ldquo;fluting&rdquo; illustrated on pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_147">147</a> and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_148">148</a>.
Figgins had found one at Folsom in 1926, but its provenience
had been denied. Koch may have found one
under a mastodon in 1839. Certainly the Smithsonian
Institution acquired in 1893 a fluted point that was
<span class="pb" id="Page_145">145</span>
picked up in New Hampshire, and other specimens
have been discovered in old collections. But, in spite
of the fact that these points were very odd in shape
and had never been found in the Old World, scientists
had paid little attention to them until 1927.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>The Lake Lahontan point, found in the glacial clays of
Nevada associated with the fossils of extinct mammals.
(After Russell, 1885.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Figgins was not the first to discover spear points&mdash;of
whatever shape&mdash;with the fossils of extinct animals
or with other evidence of considerable age. In at least
eight localities during the second half of the nineteenth
century men had made such finds; and there had been
five more finds in the first quarter of the twentieth.
Some of the first group won easy, if uncritical, acceptance;
but antagonism to the flint tools that C. C. Abbott
found near Trenton, New Jersey, was so great that he
wrote: &ldquo;Had the Delaware River been a European
stream, the implements found in its valley would have
been accepted at once as evidence of the so-called
<i>Paleolithic man</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_3" href="#fn_7_3">[3]</a> By 1925 almost everyone seemed
to have forgotten the obsidian blade that a museum
<span class="pb" id="Page_146">146</span>
director named W J McGee had pulled out of the unmistakably
glacial deposits of extinct Lake Lahontan,
Nevada, in 1882,<a class="fn" id="fr_7_4" href="#fn_7_4">[4]</a> and the spear point that had been
found in 1895 under the shoulder blade of an extinct
type of bison at Russell Springs, Kansas.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_5" href="#fn_7_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Discoveries after 1900 were, in a sense, more important
because better authenticated; but unfortunately
they had to encounter the general hostility to early
man which had been bred by a more scientific approach
to American prehistory and nurtured by Hrdli&#269;ka
at Vero and Melbourne. In 1924 the finding of
a point under a bison at Lone Wolf Creek, Texas, by
men from the Denver Museum of Natural History
went relatively unnoticed.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_6" href="#fn_7_6">[6]</a> Only harsh controversy
welcomed the discovery, at Frederick, Oklahoma, in
1926, of artifacts and a variegated array of fossilized
fauna in what the geologist E. H. Sellards believed
was a glacial formation.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_7" href="#fn_7_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>The Folsom discovery changed the hostile attitude
of almost all anthropologists toward early man. This
was partly because the evidence was so striking and
unmistakable, but largely because of the fierce white
light of scientific publicity that was made to beat about
a New Mexico arroyo.</p>
<p>The Denver Museum had found its first Folsom
point in 1926.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_8" href="#fn_7_8">[8]</a> It had been embedded in the clay surrounding
a large bone; but when Figgins spoke or
wrote of this discovery his fellow scientists suggested
that the point was &ldquo;intrusive,&rdquo; that it had dropped
down through a hole made by some rodent. So the next
year, when Figgins came upon a Folsom point between
two ribs of a bison, he stopped all work and wired to a
number of institutions in the East to send witnesses.
Barnum Brown of the American Museum of Natural
History, Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., of the Smithsonian
Institution, and Alfred V. Kidder of the Peabody Foundation
at Andover arrived to view the point <i>in situ</i>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_147">147</span>
Their testimony and the collaboration of Brown in
work at Folsom established beyond doubt that man
in America had trafficked with animals which were
supposed to have been dead by the end of the Glacial
Period. Once this was proved, other anthropologists
and institutions were off on the trail of more such finds.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>The making of a Folsom point. The flint was first flaked
to the general shape desired. (This sketch is perhaps a little
too schematic.) Next, the maker removed a long flake
on each face. Then he retouched the edges, and usually
ground the hose and the sides of the ears. (After Clarke,
1940.)</i></p>
</div>
<h3>Americans Hunted Animals Now Extinct</h3>
<p>The Folsom
find was arresting, even dramatic. Not only was
one of the nineteen points from the first three field seasons
actually lodged between the ribs of an extinct bison.
In addition, the skeletons of twenty-three of these
animals testified that here was the scene of a prehistoric
kill. Man had indeed had something to do with
these beasts before they had grown cold; for the tail
bones of each bison were missing, and hunters will tell
<span class="pb" id="Page_148">148</span>
you that, in skinning, &ldquo;the tail goes with the hide.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_9" href="#fn_7_9">[9]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig48">
<img src="images/i033.jpg" alt="" width="410" height="600" />
<p class="pcapc"><i>The minute, ribbonlike flaking of a Folsom. This drawing,
one and a half actual size, is from a broken point found
at Lindenmeier. (Courtesy of the Denver Museum of Natural
History.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Another arresting feature was the shape of the point&mdash;unique
in all the history of primitive man&mdash;and the
fact that it was better made than any other point of
equal antiquity. It was rather broad, with a deep concave
base that terminated at each side in a jutting
point, or &ldquo;ear.&rdquo; The edges were most skillfully chipped,
and the base and ears were often ground smooth. It
was particularly distinguished by the fact that a long
flake of stone had been chipped away on each face
from the base almost to the tip. The flute, or channel,
left by the flake, made the point look a little like the
end of a grooved bayonet. This is the true or classic
Folsom. An earlier type is larger, without ears, and
imperfectly grooved (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_155">page 155</a>). In
current terminology, the former is called simply Folsom,
and the other Clovis Fluted, Ohio Fluted, and so
on, depending on where the point was found.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_149">149</div>
<p>Between 1926 and 1948, more than sixty points of
the classic Folsom type appeared, and the number has
grown since then. Many were discovered on the surface,
some in association with the bones of extinct animals,
particularly <i>Bison antiquus</i>. Most appeared in
the general area of the High Plains, but some on the
west slope of the Rockies and in southern Texas. Hundreds
of Clovis and other fluted points have been found
in the field or recognized in collections; they have come
from every state but Hawaii, and from Canada. From
north of the Arctic Circle in Alaska, fluted points
range southward through Canada, the United States,
Guatemala, and Costa Rica to the highlands of Ecuador.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_10" href="#fn_7_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>There has been some argument over whether the
Folsom or the Clovis is the older. John L. Cotter reported
the finding of Clovis points and elephant fossils
near Clovis, New Mexico, in a level lower than one
containing Folsom and bison.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_11" href="#fn_7_11">[11]</a> In 1948 Harrington
pointed out that Clovis has been found four times in
association with the mammoth, as well as once with
the bison, but that, when the Folsom type is partnered
with fossils, these are almost invariably the bison&rsquo;s.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_12" href="#fn_7_12">[12]</a>
(Later finds bore him out.) The wholly extinct mammoth
is usually presumed to be older than the bison,
one species of which still lives. Furthermore, in Burnet
Cave, New Mexico, a Clovis has been found with bones
of an animal of the musk-ox type.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_13" href="#fn_7_13">[13]</a> Within fifty miles
of the Mexican border, the musk ox, says Roberts, is
&ldquo;generally considered good evidence of an ice-age
fauna.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_14" href="#fn_7_14">[14]</a> Folsom may be a localized expression of the
basic pattern, reaching perfection in the High Plains,
while Clovis spread more widely.</p>
<h3>Two Other Folsom Sites&mdash;Clovis and Lindenmeier</h3>
<p>The second site of classic Folsom was that near Clovis,
investigated first by Edgar B. Howard in 1932, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_150">150</span>
dated by the glacialist Ernst Antevs and the geologist
Kirk Bryan. It was notable on two counts. The finds
were in the dried beds of lakes that had apparently
been formed in the pluvial, or very wet, period which
occurred at least as early as the end of the last glaciation&mdash;11,000
to 12,000 years ago&mdash;and probably still
earlier. This time there were fossils of other extinct
mammals besides bison&mdash;mammoths, horses, camels,
and peccaries. In addition to Folsom and Clovis points,
Howard found an unfluted artifact which he considered
to be a Folsom knife.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_15" href="#fn_7_15">[15]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig49">

<p class="pcapc"><i>This map shows the chief sites where artifacts of early
man have been found in the Southwest. (After Hurst,
1945, with some additions.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>The third major discovery of classic Folsom artifacts
came officially in 1934, when Roberts dug a site called
Lindenmeier in Colorado; but as far back as 1924&mdash;two
years before the first discovery of a Folsom point
in New Mexico&mdash;Judge C. C. Coffin and his son, A. L.
Coffin, had begun to pick up such points in this area
<span class="pb" id="Page_151">151</span>
without recognizing their importance. Lindenmeier is
particularly significant because it was an occupational
site, a camp of some duration. It was also a factory, for
Roberts found spear points, scrapers, and other tools
in various stages of manufacture. Again there were bison
bones.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_16" href="#fn_7_16">[16]</a> There were also traces of camel, as well
as an elephant tusk not too closely associated with the
artifacts. A skillful geological study of the old and elevated
river terrace on which the site is located linked
it with glacial moraines which indicate a readvance of
the glacial ice.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_17" href="#fn_7_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>The date of Folsom man is uncertain. Some believe
he lived during the last years of the Great Ice Age.
Some place him a little later than the melting of the
glaciers. The earliest radiocarbon date yet determined
for Folsom is from the Lindenmeier site, where bits of
charcoal provided a date of 10,780 &plusmn; 375 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_18" href="#fn_7_18">[18]</a> It
took about 700 man-hours of tedious and painstaking
work to locate and recover this charcoal. Elsewhere, at
such Texas sites as Blackwater Draw, Lubbock, and
Scharbauer, direct or indirect dates indicate a survival
of the Folsom culture until about 9,000 years ago.</p>
<p>One thing is certain: the Folsom point won the battle
for early man in the Americas because it proved that
he or his predecessors had hunted extinct bison, camels,
mammoths, peccaries, and horses. Hitherto every
find of human artifacts with fossils had been thrown
out of court on the argument that the artifacts might
be intrusive. That charge could not be leveled at two of
these unique Folsom points because they were found
in a unique and decisive position&mdash;one between the
ribs of an animal and the other penetrating the channel
of the spinal cord.</p>
<p>Some of the opponents of early man were not convinced.
They shifted the argument. Man was early, the
Hrdli&#269;kas admitted, but not so very early, because the
bison and the elephant were late. More of that in a
<span class="pb" id="Page_152">152</span>
later chapter. Meantime, it is worth noting that a
humble invertebrate, a mollusk, found in the Clovis
dig, suggests that the Folsom-bearing deposits were
glacial.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_19" href="#fn_7_19">[19]</a></p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>Disposal of the dead by exposure, as practiced among
hunting tribes. (After Sollas, 1911.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>You may ask why we have not found Folsom man
himself. Howard has pointed out that early man, as a
migrant hunter, would probably have followed much
<span class="pb" id="Page_153">153</span>
the same customs as our Plains Indians in the disposal
of his dead. He would have left the bodies exposed on
scaffolds or in trees, or he would have cremated them.
&ldquo;Under such circumstances,&rdquo; Howard writes, &ldquo;it would
be the merest chance to come across a skeleton of Folsom
man anywhere in the enormous area of our Great
Plains country. It would be even more remarkable to
recognize him as such, unless he had a Folsom point in
his hand or was holding an elephant by the tail.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_20" href="#fn_7_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The Clovis fluted point is not so fine a piece of craftsmanship
as the Folsom, yet it is more significant as evidence
of very early man in North America. Clovis
points tend to be longer, larger, and heavier than the
Folsom. The fluting is rather rudimentary. The earlike
tips characteristic of Folsom usually are lacking in Clovis,
and careful finishing or retouching of the edges is
rare. The refinement of workmanship in Folsom suggests
that Clovis antedated it. This, as we have indicated,
is borne out by the fact that Clovis-like points
are usually found with mammoth bones rather than
those of the later bison. These points are widely distributed,
but the best associations have been found at
or near Houston, Midland, Miami, and Abilene, in
Texas, and at the Naco and Lehner sites, in Arizona.
The first such point definitely associated with the remains
of a mammoth was found near Dent, Colorado,
in 1932.</p>
<p>Another extinct mammal besides the mammoth and
<i>Bison antiquus</i> has been found in early sites&mdash;the mastodon.
The animal is not typical of any particular time
period, or associated with any special kind of projectile
point. It would seem that people of early cultures
in the eastern United States hunted this beast with
a variety of stemmed projectile points until about
5,500 years ago. Mastodons occur at least five times in
probable association with early man, according to
Stephen Williams. He lists the discoveries at Island 35
<span class="pb" id="Page_154">154</span>
in the Mississippi River; Tipton County, Tennessee;
Koch&rsquo;s much publicized finds in Gasconade and Benton
Counties, Missouri; along with the Richmond mastodon,
near Cromwell, Indiana; and the Orleton Farms
mastodon, near Plumwood, Ohio.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_21" href="#fn_7_21">[21]</a></p>
<h3>Another Fine and Ancient Point</h3>
<p>Folsom man and his
spear point had only just begun to worry conservative
anthropologists when A. E. Jenks&mdash;who was to champion
skeletons of early man in Minnesota&mdash;noted, in
1928, a still finer type of flint in the collection of Perry
and Harold Anderson, of Yuma County, Colorado. It
was long and narrow, with parallel sides and a triangular
point, and looked rather like a half-bayonet without
its Folsom flute. It was consummately chipped by
pressure over its whole surface. These artifacts were at
first known as Yuma, but now they are called Eden,
after a site in Eden Valley, Wyoming, where they were
found <i>in situ</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_22" href="#fn_7_22">[22]</a> They are easily the finest job of flint
knapping in the New World, equaled only by the later
neolithic daggers of Egypt and Scandinavia (see illustrations,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_158">page 158</a>). This might be a good argument for
Eden points&rsquo; being neolithic, if artifacts with Eden
chipping had not been discovered in association with
Folsom tools and also with the fossils of extinct mammals.
Evidence from a site near Cody, Wyoming, indicates
that the Eden industry as a whole is younger than
the Folsom. The Eden points found there are nearer
7,000 than 11,000 years old,<a class="fn" id="fr_7_23" href="#fn_7_23">[23]</a> for the soil in which they
lay was formed during a moist period late in that interval
of time. Eden and similar points are fairly widespread;
some have been found in Canada and in
Alaska.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_24" href="#fn_7_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Anthropologists now recognize two chief varieties of
Eden points. One of these is beautifully patterned
by long, parallel pressure flakes that cross the blade
obliquely on a low diagonal. In the other, parallel
flakes meet on a center line. The base and lower edges
are usually ground. There is often a single or a double
shoulder for hafting. Many anthropologists list another
type, the Scottsbluff; it is flaked like the Eden, but
shorter and wider, and it has a definite stem with right-angle
notches.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_156">156</div>
<h3>The Plainview Point</h3>
<p>Another type of early point has
given students a good deal of trouble. It is shaped
somewhat like a Folsom but it has no long chip, or flute,
removed from its two faces. The lower edges are often
ground. Its surface is sometimes chipped like an
Eden with collateral flaking, and sometimes patterned
with larger, and less regular flakes. When such points
were found with Folsoms, they were often called Folsom-like.
As the result of the discovery in 1945 by Glen
L. Evans and Grayson E. Meade of eighteen whole or
broken points of this sort near Plainview, Texas, in association
with numerous fossils of extinct bison, there
is a tendency to give these &ldquo;Unfluted Folsoms&rdquo; the
label Plainview.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_25" href="#fn_7_25">[25]</a> Like the Folsoms, Plainview points
can now be recognized among artifacts collected before
their recognition as a distinct type. F. G. Rainey and
Frank Hibben have found them in the frozen muck of
central Alaska, identifying them by the older names
of Yuma-like (Eden) or Generalized Folsom.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_26" href="#fn_7_26">[26]</a> This
muck is an extraordinary formation four to one hundred
feet deep. Packed into it are masses of dismembered
skeletons of the mammoth, a jaguar, and other
extinct mammals, accompanied here and there by ligaments
of flesh and hair. Hibben picked up a point in a
curio store at Ketchikan on the southern coast of
Alaska, and another from Chinitna Bay on the shore of
Cook Inlet, both of which he called Yuma-like, but
which may now be regarded as very much like Plainviews.
Alex Krieger lists as Plainviews a considerable
number of points which have been hitherto identified
<span class="pb" id="Page_157">157</span>
as Clovis or Eden at sixteen different sites<a class="fn" id="fr_7_27" href="#fn_7_27">[27]</a> (see
illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_155">page 155</a>).</p>
<p>Krieger suggests that Plainview lies between Folsom
and Eden in its type of flint work. Later excavations
may prove that the three points have a similar historical
relationship, and may throw more light on some
nine or ten other types of points that early man seems
to have made.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_28" href="#fn_7_28">[28]</a></p>

<h3>A New Point&mdash;and Sloths&mdash;in Gypsum Cave</h3>
<p>After the
discovery of the Eden point, the next important development
came in 1930 with M. R. Harrington&rsquo;s excavation
of Gypsum Cave, Nevada. Here he found the
dung, hair, skin, and bones of the ground sloth in clear
association with a wide variety of artifacts. Besides the
sloth, there were fossils of camel and perhaps horse.
Among the artifacts was a new type of diamond-shaped
point, and&mdash;quite as remarkable&mdash;there were
parts of painted dart shafts with the butts pitted for use
with a spear-thrower. In addition to knives and oval
scrapers, there were fire hearths. Gypsum man burned
sloth dung as well as wood, and used torches. Harrington
dated the culture at about 10,500 years ago. Radiocarbon
<span class="pb" id="Page_160">160</span>
dates from sloth dung six feet four inches
deep averaged 10,455 &plusmn; 340 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_30" href="#fn_7_30">[30]</a> Similar material
closer to the surface recorded 8,527 &plusmn; 250 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_31" href="#fn_7_31">[31]</a>
Thus Gypsum seems to follow Folsom.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_32" href="#fn_7_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>Such discoveries of the traces of early man in the
United States and Canada spurred anthropologists to
new work in the field, with the result that we now
have over one hundred sites where a few of man&rsquo;s
bones or a host of his artifacts have been found with
the fossils of bison, elephant, camel, horse, or sloth or
in geological strata that date him close to the Great Ice
Age and probably in it. Seven North American sites,
and two in Middle America remain to be discussed.
Some are outstanding in evidence of age.</p>
<h3>Old Lake and River Sites</h3>
<p>In 1934 and 1935 Mr. and
Mrs. W. H. Campbell found traces of man along the
beaches of vanished lakes in the southern California
desert. At first Antevs believed that the lakes formed
when the glaciers were melting away 20,000 to 25,000
years ago, but now he dates the artifacts and camp
sites as less than 9,000 years old. At Lake Mohave, in
the Campbells&rsquo; first year of work, they found only stone
tools&mdash;Mohave and Silver Lake points&mdash;but in the Pinto
Basin they came upon the bones of extinct mammals
as well as artifacts.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_33" href="#fn_7_33">[33]</a> Malcolm J. Rogers challenges the
dating of Mohave and Pinto as &ldquo;largely a matter of
opinion,&rdquo; and believes that &ldquo;even approximate dates
... cannot be set.&rdquo; In his own opinion, Pinto points&mdash;mixed
with Gypsum in the same area&mdash;range only from
1,800 to 2,800 years ago. The Lake Mohave industry
cannot begin, he maintains, earlier than 3,000 to 4,000
years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_34" href="#fn_7_34">[34]</a> In 1946, Robert F. Heizer and Edwin M.
Lemert and later A. E. Treganza discovered in Topanga
Canyon, north of Los Angeles, points and crude
scrapers and choppers very like those at Lake Mohave
and Gypsum Cave and also milling stones.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_35" href="#fn_7_35">[35]</a> Lake
<span class="pb" id="Page_161">161</span>
Mohave artifacts have been found in northwestern
Canada.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_36" href="#fn_7_36">[36]</a></p>
<p>A number of sites in the West and Southwest are
particularly notable for their age or for the character
of their artifacts, or for both. Some push the record of
man in America back beyond Folsom, possibly far, far
beyond; and some bring into the picture a type of artifact&mdash;the
milling stone&mdash;which does not seem to have
appeared in Europe until later. The publications upon
these sites from 1935 to 1941 aroused much controversy
even while broadening and deepening our knowledge
of early man.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>Three early points from the borders of extinct lakes in

</div>
<p>Confusion, as well as controversy, distinguishes the
area which might prove the most significant of the
four if more extended work were done there by geologists
as well as archaeologists. This area is in the
neighborhood of Abilene, Texas, and includes the
banks of the Elm Creek branch of the Brazos River.
Cyrus N. Ray, a local physician, has studied the Abilene
sites assiduously for twenty years. In 1931 Gila
<span class="pb" id="Page_162">162</span>
Pueblo&mdash;Harold S. Gladwin&rsquo;s research institution&mdash;sent
E. B. Sayles to work there. Later Gila arranged to have
Antevs, Howard, and M. M. Leighton, Chief of the Illinois
State Geological Survey, study the finds and the
sites. It is unfortunate that the men who worked in this
area have not agreed on a consistent set of names for
the various cultures and geological formations. As
H. M. Wormington has observed, &ldquo;the only way to approach
publications dealing with the archaeology of
this region is with a large bottle of aspirin in either
hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="img" id="fig56">
<img src="images/i040.jpg" alt="" width="173" height="501" />
<p class="caption"><i>An Abilene point. (After Wormington, 1944.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>The artifacts occurred in two strata. The upper
contained points of types now called Plainview and
Milnesand and a long, narrow point that has been
dubbed Abilene, though not accepted as a distinct
type by Texas archaeologists. Leighton placed these
tools from what he called the Elm Creek Silts in
the latter portion of our last Glacial period.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_37" href="#fn_7_37">[37]</a> To
reach Abilene at this time, early man may have passed
through the gap that is thought to have appeared in
the ice sheet east of the Rockies 40,000 years ago, or
<span class="pb" id="Page_163">163</span>
else when the Wisconsin ice of the last glaciers was in
retreat 20,000 years later (see illustrations, pages <a class="pgref" href="#Page_26">26</a>
and <a class="pgref" href="#Page_27">27</a>).</p>
<p>Still greater age is claimed for certain other objects
of the Abilene area. Below the Elm Creek Silts lie the
Durst Silts, which were laid down, Leighton thinks,
prior to the last glaciation.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_38" href="#fn_7_38">[38]</a> In connection with these
silts Sayles found what may be very crude artifacts.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_39" href="#fn_7_39">[39]</a>
They are the &ldquo;eoliths&rdquo; that, wherever found in the Old
World, are accepted or attacked as problematical evidences
of man&rsquo;s first attempts at roughly chipped artifacts.
If these are indeed the work of man, and if
Leighton is right, the men who made them must have
come to Texas during the Sangamon Interglacial period
preceding the last, or Wisconsin, glaciation&mdash;a
matter of perhaps 70,000 years ago.</p>
<p>Some authorities attack Leighton&rsquo;s dating and therefore
Sayles&rsquo;s eoliths. The reported discovery later of
Abilene and other points in the Durst Silts suggested to
Kirk Bryan that the silts would have to be moved up
in time.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_40" href="#fn_7_40">[40]</a> He might have argued that the artifacts
should be moved back, which would have been in line
with his championing of very early man elsewhere.
Agreeing with Bryan and C. C. Albritton, Frank C.
Hibben redated the Durst Silts by connecting them
with a late glacier in the Rocky Mountains rather than
with the Wisconsin ice field of the north.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_41" href="#fn_7_41">[41]</a> Leighton,
on the other hand, maintained&mdash;and he has had some
good support&mdash;that the soil at various depths had been
radically changed by chemical action which would
take tens of thousands of years. This &ldquo;soil profile&rdquo;
theory as a test of geological age is gaining in importance.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_42" href="#fn_7_42">[42]</a></p>
<h3>Sandia&mdash;Older Than Folsom</h3>
<p>However problematical
these evidences of pre-Folsom man near Abilene
may be, there can be no doubt about the meaning of
<span class="pb" id="Page_164">164</span>
Frank C. Hibben&rsquo;s discoveries in Sandia Cave, New
Mexico, in 1936. He began by finding the remains of
Pueblo Indians. Under the Pueblo he came upon a
layer of stalagmitic travertine one-half inch to six
inches thick, laid down during a moist period. Sealed
off beneath this were classic Folsom points together
with scrapers and evidence of extinct mammals. Next
he found another sterile seal, two inches to two feet
thick. This time it was of yellow ocher&mdash;a substance induced
by fir and spruce under moist conditions, Kirk
Bryan points out. Fir and spruce require more cold and
more moisture than the neighborhood of Sandia provides
at present&mdash;which argues that the ocher was manufactured
during the last pulsation of the fourth and
final glaciation more than 11,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_43" href="#fn_7_43">[43]</a> Beneath
this stratum Hibben found a new type of point.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_44" href="#fn_7_44">[44]</a> New
to the New World, that is, but not to the Old; for it resembles
in a crude way a point of the Solutrean culture
of Europe which has a notch at the bottom to aid
in hafting. Since this discovery, points of the same type
have turned up sporadically throughout the Mississippi
Valley, along the eastern seaboard, and even in California.
In every case, Hibben writes, there were indications
of &ldquo;considerable antiquity.&rdquo; In fourteen instances
out of thirty-eight, &ldquo;the points were found with
extinct bones, although in each case by amateurs.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_45" href="#fn_7_45">[45]</a></p>
<p>The Sandia point is, of course, definitely older than
the Folsom. The two periods of moisture indicate that
the cave was inhabited by Folsom man toward the
end of the last glaciation, or 9,000 to 11,000 years ago,
and by Sandia man still earlier. Unless, of course, you
wish to believe, as some do, that both pluvial periods
were Postglacial.</p>
<p>Quite understandably, Sandia has been of keen interest
to archaeologists. The geology tells us only that
the Folsom and the Sandia occupations of the cave
were separated by a cool, moist interval that could reflect
<span class="pb" id="Page_165">165</span>
a major glacial advance, a minor glacial advance,
or merely a postglacial period of lowered temperature
and more snow or rain. The last seems the least likely
alternative. None of these possibilities gives us a firm
date. Accordingly, the development of the radiocarbon
&ldquo;clock&rdquo; by Willard Libby raised some hope that
the age of Sandia points could, at last, be determined.
This hope continues, but has yet to be realized. Radiocarbon
tests made by H. R. Crane, at the University of
Michigan, upon fragments of mammoth tusk indicate
an age of at least 20,000 years, with the reasonable possibility
that the true age exceeds 30,000 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_46" href="#fn_7_46">[46]</a> The
problems remain. The association of Sandia points
with mammoth tusk was not as clear as Folsom point
with extinct bison. And the problem of the reliability
of ivory in radiocarbon tests&mdash;as well as the ever-present
question of possible contamination&mdash;urges caution
in accepting this date for Sandia.</p>

<p>A site discovered at Lime Creek, Nebraska, in 1947
<span class="pb" id="Page_166">166</span>
may prove to be old. In the sharp bank of the stream
C. Bertrand Schultz found crude points, bone awls,
scrapers, and tools made out of antlers. Together with
fossils of mammals they lay as deep as forty-seven and
one-half feet below the surface, in a silt containing the
remains of decayed vegetation. Above this soil were
seventeen feet of loess, another layer of soil, another
layer of loess, and finally a &ldquo;mature&rdquo; or well developed,
and therefore fairly old top soil. Schultz and W. D.
Frankforter write that the seventeen feet of loess covering
the earth in which the artifacts were found appears
to have been deposited before or at the beginning
of the last expansion of the Wisconsin, or final,
glaciation.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_47" href="#fn_7_47">[47]</a> If this is true, it means that the men of
Lime Creek lived 25,000 or 35,000 years ago, and that
their forebears may have come through the corridor in
the ice fields of Canada 5,000 to 18,000 years earlier
(see <a class="pgref" href="#Page_27">page 27</a>). Antevs and Wormington doubt it.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_48" href="#fn_7_48">[48]</a>
Radiocarbon dates from burned logs found below the
Lime Creek artifacts averaged 9,524 &plusmn; 450 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_49" href="#fn_7_49">[49]</a> It
is possible that these stone tools are contemporaneous
with Folsom, or even a bit later.</p>
<h3>The Milling Stone Appears</h3>
<p>In the early thirties, archaeologists
began to find a peculiar kind of artifact
that broadened their conception of the activities of
early man in the New World. Anthropologists had always
thought of him as merely a hunter. He needed
spear points, scrapers, knives, hammerstones to shape
these things, and fire-drills to make it possible for him
to cook his prey; but that was all. Then milling stones
began to appear, and it became clear that early man&mdash;at
least in some areas&mdash;had been a food gatherer
and food grinder, as well as a hunter. These stones
are very simple slabs with a hollow worn in the surface
by round handstones used in grinding seeds and nuts.
Such milling stones, or querns, are not seen in the
<span class="pb" id="Page_167">167</span>
Old World until we approach the Neolithic, or New
Stone Age, and the people who developed agriculture
and textiles. Milling stones have been found in a
village farming site at Jarmo, Iraq, dating about 7,000
years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_50" href="#fn_7_50">[50]</a> Agriculture did not enter Europe until
about 2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>, and milling stones are not found
in its caves until after the Magdalenians of the Old
Stone Age. The reason for the precipitate outcropping
of milling stones in the Americas is not that our early
man practiced agriculture. He did not do that, and he
did not make polished stone axes until much later. He
was merely a food gatherer. Was he also a food grinder
because he was an Australoid who brought the habit
to America, just as he brought it to Australia? Or, if not,
was he another sort of man, who happened to be smart
enough to recognize that North America provided him
with many tempting grains and seeds to grind, foods
that were not so available in the Old World?<a class="fn" id="fr_7_51" href="#fn_7_51">[51]</a> It
seems more than a coincidence that the earliest American
milling stones appear in the arid Southwest, where
desert plants have more seeds and larger seeds than
plants in moister areas.</p>
<p>The first site to provide milling stones was at Whitewater
Creek, in Arizona. Byron Cummings had found
artifacts and fossils there in 1926. When Gladwin
heard of this at an anthropological meeting five years
later, he again set Gila Pueblo in motion. Sayles and
Emil W. Haury undertook excavation, and Antevs
checked the geology of the various sites which they
studied in the area of what is now called the Cochise
culture.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_52" href="#fn_7_52">[52]</a> The excavators found milling stones in the
same stratum as the fossils of extinct animals. They
found no spear points in this oldest level&mdash;a sign that
food gathering was the dominant economy of the
early Cochise.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_169">169</div>
<p>The artifacts and the fossils were lying in or under
clays left by a lake that has now disappeared. If Lake
Cochise was, like Lake Bonneville, one of the bodies
of water created while the last great ice sheets were
growing, then the Cochise culture must date from the
last wet period of the final glaciation&mdash;perhaps as much
as 35,000 years ago. Antevs thinks, however, that the
water which laid down the clays belonged to a number
of ponds, not to a single large lake, and that the ponds
could have formed and disappeared, formed again
and disappeared again, just before postglacial times
brought a much drier climate. Any single pond may
have appeared as late as 10,000 years ago to provide
the Cochise clay. Radiocarbon dates for Cochise all
seem too recent to fit the geology and paleontology of
the site. Dates for the earliest stage, the Sulphur
Spring, range from 6,210 to 7,000 years ago; the
Chiricahua from 2,850 to 7,000; the last, the San Pedro,
from 1,762 to 2,463.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_53" href="#fn_7_53">[53]</a> Antevs, on the other hand, believes
that the Sulphur Spring stage at Double Adobe&mdash;twenty-four
miles east of the Lehner mammoth site
where Clovis points were found&mdash;dates back more than
12,500 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_54" href="#fn_7_54">[54]</a></p>
<p>Finds of milling stones have also been made at Signal
Butte, Nebraska, by W. D. Strong; at Pinto Basin
by the Campbells<a class="fn" id="fr_7_55" href="#fn_7_55">[55]</a>&mdash;the first site probably about as
early as Gypsum, the other 10,000 years old&mdash;and under
hardpan at that much disputed site near Frederick,
Oklahoma, where some claim that artifacts and fossils
of extinct animals appear together in an interglacial
formation. Milling stones have also been found at sites
of later cultures such as the Edwards Plateau in Texas
and Santa Barbara in California. There are indications
of an ancient horizon of milling stones, as well as Pinto
and older points and scrapers, in Sonora and Lower
California. The fact that they were found with the
bones of elk and bison and along the shores of dry lakes
in Mexico argues that this culture is as old as Cochise,
perhaps older. Carl Sauer, who found the materials, believes
<span class="pb" id="Page_170">170</span>
that only during the last glaciation could the
climate of these two desert areas have been moist
enough to produce lakes and support so much animal
life.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_56" href="#fn_7_56">[56]</a></p>
<p>At Borax Lake in California, in several years of work
following 1938, Harrington found more milling stones.
There were also quite a variety of points&mdash;fluted,
Gypsum, Pinto, Mohave, and Silver Lake&mdash;scattered
through an alluvial fan of dirt carried down by some
early stream that flowed when the country was well
watered and verdant, instead of arid like so much of
California today.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_57" href="#fn_7_57">[57]</a></p>
<p>In 1948 Harrington and Willy Stahl found milling
stones and a great wealth of Pinto, Mohave, and Silver
Lake points in another part of California that is now
desert. This is near Little Lake, which is fed by underground
waters and small intermittent streams from the
Sierra. Nearby, in glacial times, a small river cut a
channel through a great lava flow, producing a falls
that has now moved up half a mile from the edge of the
lava. Here, where the blow sands of the Mohave Desert
meet the lava, and under about ten feet of old,
consolidated sand, Harrington and Stahl found milling
stones and points in two feet of soil. This soil was dark
with the remains of vegetation that must have been
trees and bushes when the intermittent stream was still
a steady torrent. Underneath the dark soil there was
clay deposited by the stream at some period of great
flow. Across about two-thirds of the camp site a similar
coating of clay indicated that after the user of the
milling stones and Pinto points had departed, the
stream had overflowed again during a time of great
rains. This time may have been the &ldquo;Little Pluvial&rdquo; of
about 3,000 years ago, or the &ldquo;Great Pluvial&rdquo; that some
say occurred 10,000 years ago when the glaciers had
finally retreated, with the former the more likely date.
In this camp site Harrington and Stahl found the post
<span class="pb" id="Page_171">171</span>
holes of some sort of hut or shelter, the oldest evidence
of housebuilding in the New World.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_58" href="#fn_7_58">[58]</a></p>

<h3>A Paucity of Art Objects</h3>
<p>Advanced as early man
in America may have been in his stone industry, he
seems to have been singularly backward in making the
kind of spiritualized artifact which we call art. In the
caves of France and Spain men of the Old Stone Age
left remarkable paintings and sculptures of animals.
There is nothing like this of corresponding age in the
Americas. Early man in Europe and in Northern Asia
turned out many little figures of women&mdash;undoubtedly
symbols of fecundity, since the female characteristics
are highly exaggerated; but in the New World female
figurines are to be found only in later levels such as
those of the Eskimo, Southwestern, and Middle American
cultures, all of which date from close to the birth
of Christ. Of all the forms of art, we have few examples
that may have been made by early man. In the United
States there are the dubious trio of crude, round heads
which Sellards reports from a gravel pit in Henderson
County, Texas.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_59" href="#fn_7_59">[59]</a> During the digging of a canal in the
Valley of Mexico in 1870, a workman picked out of a
fossil-bearing stratum a bony section of what was described
as an extinct llama, or camel, carved in the
shape of a coyote&rsquo;s head. It was about forty feet below
the surface of the ground in the same layer of earth
with fossils of elephant, horse, giant armadillo, and
camel.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_60" href="#fn_7_60">[60]</a> The Lindenmeier Folsom site produced
decorated discs of bone, possibly used as game markers.
Most interesting of all is the fragment of mammoth or
mastodon bone recovered in the summer of 1959 about
ten miles southeast of Puebla, Mexico, by Juan Armenta
Camacho. On a six-inch wedge of bone, estimated
to have been 30,000 years old, are the crudely
carved outlines of bison, tapir, and mammoths or
mastodons, carved while the bone was still fresh.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_61" href="#fn_7_61">[61]</a></p>

<h3>Hand Axes in the Americas</h3>
<p>Of all the bits of stone
that bear on the existence of early man in America,
perhaps the most puzzling&mdash;and certainly the most
neglected&mdash;are the artifacts which E. B. Renaud has
found in countless numbers in southwestern Wyoming.
Here at 105 sites on the arid surface of Black&rsquo;s Fork
Valley he had picked up by 1940 some 7,000 chipped
stones&mdash;many of them like rude hand axes&mdash;which suggest
a parallel with the industries of paleolithic man in
the Old World.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_62" href="#fn_7_62">[62]</a> European authorities such as J. Reid
Moir, champion of English eoliths, Reginald A. Smith,
of the British Museum, and D. Peyroni, of the Mus&eacute;e
des Eyzies, have stated that Renaud&rsquo;s finds agree in
type with the hand axes, choppers, and blades of the
Abbevillian, Acheulean, Mousterian, and Clactonian
cultures of Europe and Africa. While emphasizing the
resemblances, Renaud is careful to claim no parallel
in time.</p>
<p>Renaud&rsquo;s artifacts recall a gathering of hand axes
under most unscientific circumstances more than sixty
years ago. In the late 1880&rsquo;s Thomas Wilson of the
National Museum became convinced that the collections
under his care contained numerous hand axes of
<span class="pb" id="Page_174">174</span>
paleolithic type and age. He listed 950 in the Museum
and appealed through a printed circular for more examples.
He got them. His correspondents in thirty-five
states donated 789 and described enough more to bring
the total up to 8,501.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_63" href="#fn_7_63">[63]</a></p>
<div class="img" id="fig61">

<p class="pcapc"><i>A hand ax of the Black&rsquo;s Fork culture. (Courtesy of the
Denver Museum of Natural History.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Wilson&rsquo;s hand axes and Renaud&rsquo;s artifacts were attacked
in the same manner. W. H. Holmes of the Bureau
of American Ethnology had little trouble in convincing
the scientific public that Wilson&rsquo;s array of
casually collected material came from quarries and
workshops of the Indian and were cores from which
he had struck flakes to make points or scrapers. The
critics of Renaud&rsquo;s artifacts pointed to certain similar
objects found less plentifully in late camp sites on the
Plains, and suggested that Renaud&rsquo;s artifacts might be
<span class="pb" id="Page_175">175</span>
merely the blanks and rejects of a relatively recent
stone industry.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_64" href="#fn_7_64">[64]</a> Many of the finds are certainly not
finished implements, and the date of the Black&rsquo;s Fork
culture is still problematical; but among Renaud&rsquo;s material
there are hand axes and scrapers that bear comparison
with the cruder Chellean and Acheulean work.
There are also chopping tools of Asiatic and African
pattern, made from edged pebbles that have been deliberately
chipped, first from one side, then from the
other.</p>
<p>Flints of Abbevillian and Acheulean types&mdash;whether
true artifacts or rejects&mdash;have been recorded by Kirk
Bryan at Cerro Pedernal in New Mexico.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_65" href="#fn_7_65">[65]</a> At Lake
Mohave in the Pinto Basin, Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Campbell
have found points of a Mousterian shape and
scrapers suggestive of the Aurignacian. They are so
crude, however, that they seem more like the &ldquo;elementary
ideas&rdquo; which, as Bastian claimed, could be the
product of primitive man anywhere. In Texas, there
are many tools so well developed and so close to
Acheulean forms that they cannot be turned aside as
either &ldquo;elementary ideas&rdquo; or blanks and rejects. These
are the hand axes which Sayles and other archaeologists
have found.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_66" href="#fn_7_66">[66]</a></p>
<h3>Early Man in Mexico</h3>
<p>Besides the skull that de Terra
found with the fossils of elephants in Mexico, there are
artifacts south of the border which reinforce the argument
for early man. They are more important than the
chance resemblance to a Folsom point which Junius
Bird found with sloth bones in a cave in southern Chile,
or the Eden-like point which has turned up in Venezuela.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_67" href="#fn_7_67">[67]</a></p>
<p>During de Terra&rsquo;s studies of the dry lake beds of the
Valley of Mexico and the glacial moraines on the surrounding
mountains&mdash;studies which began late in 1945&mdash;he
discovered stone tools in two culture levels. These
levels fall in two pluvial periods just before and just
after the end of the Great Ice Age.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_176">176</div>

tools made from pebbles in Asia and Africa. (Courtesy of
Gila Pueblo.)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_177">177</div>
<p>The older culture level&mdash;called San Juan&mdash;contained
ten artifacts, including scrapers, gravers, flakes, and
chipped pebbles of obsidian and chalcedony and a
pointed bone tool, together with fossils of mammoth,
sloth, camel, bison, and horse. De Terra found some
of this material at Tequixquiac and some near Teotihuac&aacute;n,
where Manuel Gamio came upon fossil bones
of mammoth and bison when he was excavating that
famous site. Close to where de Terra discovered the
skull of early man discussed in <a href="#c8">Chapter 6</a>, another anthropologist
is said to have picked up part of a point
of Folsom type&mdash;the first to be recorded south of the
United States. De Terra places the San Juan culture
12,000 to 20,000 years ago.</p>
<p>The younger culture&mdash;called Chalco&mdash;provided sixty-five
variegated artifacts of basalt, including one point.
The presence of manos&mdash;roundish stones for grinding
seeds on a milling stone&mdash;as well as other artifacts,
causes de Terra to compare this culture with the Cochise
in Arizona. He dates the Chalco culture at 4,000
to 10,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_68" href="#fn_7_68">[68]</a></p>
<p>The only evidence from Central America&mdash;neither
skulls nor artifacts&mdash;is extraordinary in nature, but as
yet makes no definite contribution in terms of years.
The finds are the footprints of men, women, and children
in a lava bed at El Cauce near Managua, Nicaragua.
They were buried beneath many feet of ash and
lava and four separate layers of soil. At a time of great
rainfall&mdash;which suggests a pluvial connected with
either the formation or the melting of the glaciers&mdash;a
<span class="pb" id="Page_178">178</span>
river excavated a channel sixty feet wide and almost
ten feet deep. Geologists have not yet ventured to give
us a date. There are tracks, however, of a bison&mdash;an
animal long extinct so far south.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_69" href="#fn_7_69">[69]</a> Other fossil human
footprints, in sandstone and perhaps of a more recent
time, have been found near Usulut&aacute;n, El Salvador.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_70" href="#fn_7_70">[70]</a></p>
<p>The story of early man in the Americas, so far as it is
interpreted by the finding of his artifacts, did not begin
with Folsom and will not end with the most recent discoveries
in Middle America. As far back as 1869 a geologist
named C. J. King found a pestle&mdash;considered in
the Old World a product of the Neolithic, or New
Stone Age of polished artifacts&mdash;so firmly cemented
into the gold-bearing gravels under Table Mountain
near Tuttleton, California, that he &ldquo;forced it out of its
place with considerable difficulty.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_71" href="#fn_7_71">[71]</a> (Other ground
and polished implements had been reported from mine
shafts in the 1860&rsquo;s, but none had been found by a
geologist imbedded in gravels.) As late as 1919, W. H.
Holmes, ever critical of evidence for early man, called
King&rsquo;s pestle &ldquo;the most important observation yet
made by a geologist bearing upon the problem of man&rsquo;s
antiquity in America.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_72" href="#fn_7_72">[72]</a> If the gravels in which the
pestle was found and the lava which lay just above it
were indeed products of the Pliocene period which
preceded the Great Ice Age, then we have to face a
staggering idea. We have to believe that a strain of
<i>Homo sapiens</i> originated in the New World long before
Java man. We have to believe that he acquired
the skills of the New Stone Age far ahead of man in the
Old World, and that he then disappeared. It is easier&mdash;but
not too easy&mdash;to think that the lava flowed in recent
times, after glacial waters had worked a pestle of early
man into the gold-bearing gravels, which would push
the seed-grinders of California far, far back in time. It
is still easier to believe that King was out of his head.
It should be noted that California Indians, except along
<span class="pb" id="Page_179">179</span>
the Colorado River, never did develop a neolithic, or
agricultural, level of technology. Their ground and polished
stone implements were applied to the objects of
a specialized seed-gathering economy. In Old World
terms, such activity tends to characterize late paleolithic
economies, where big-game hunting was not
feasible.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>The broken pestle found by C. J. King in gold-bearing
gravels in California. (After Becker, 1891.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>The excavations and studies of the next few years
may not provide evidence as startling as King&rsquo;s, but
radiocarbon promises to date any site of early man
where a few ounces of charcoal can be found. Among
the first dates provided by Libby was one between
6,300 and 6,900 years ago for trees charred by the eruption
of pumice from Mt. Mazama, Oregon, and beneath
this pumice lie four or five sites where L. S. Cressman
found artifacts of early man and the fossils of horse and
camel.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_73" href="#fn_7_73">[73]</a> By means of radiocarbon and, here and there,
newer and perhaps equally refined techniques, anthropologists
are beginning to learn a little more about the
relationships in time and culture between the prehistoric
makers of the weapons and tools we have described.
<span class="pb" id="Page_180">180</span>
Yet out of more than 150 sites, there are only
a few where datings are fully reliable.</p>
<h3>From the Glacial to the Archaic</h3>
<p>The record of early
man in North America may be dealt with on five levels,
each overlapping another. The most recent is
sometimes called the Archaic Period&mdash;the stage before
native civilizations took shape&mdash;and it lies outside the
range of early man as we define him. The earliest of
the other four levels is the most significant and the
least known. We have no suitable name for this period,
which stretches back from about 15,000 years ago into
the very dim past. It may have begun early in the last
glacial age or even in the third interglacial; this would
take our earliest man back 50,000 to 100,000 years.
There are no firm dates for this. The best we have is a
radiocarbon estimate of 30,000 years ago, when man
may have killed dwarf elephants on an island off the
coast of California.</p>
<p>Let us start with some dates and associations that
follow the end of that mysterious first level 15,000 years
ago, and carry us up to the brink of the Archaic. Let
us then go back to the few hazy glimpses we now have
of the very beginnings of man in the Americas.</p>
<p>We must start with the fluted points of Clovis. They
may range from 10,000 to 15,000 years back&mdash;more
likely 11,000 to 13,000. It is still uncertain whether the
shouldered points of Sandia fit into this time span or
precede it. For various technical reasons, we must
throw out a date of more than 37,000 years ago for
Clovis points from Lewisville, Texas, and a date of
8,500 at the Lehner site in Arizona. Points remarkably
like those from the Clovis-type site appear in such
places as Bull Brook, Massachusetts,<a class="fn" id="fr_7_74" href="#fn_7_74">[74]</a> and Alaska,<a class="fn" id="fr_7_75" href="#fn_7_75">[75]</a>
but dating is either lacking or insecure, and a 10,000- to
15,000-year age may not agree comfortably with
other geological or cultural associations. Archaeologists
<span class="pb" id="Page_181">181</span>
have been tempted to associate this horizon with the
hunting of mammoths.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_76" href="#fn_7_76">[76]</a></p>
<p>The Folsom period is next, and fairly well dated. The
span of time during which these classic fluted points
were made seems to fall mainly between 9,000 and
11,000 years ago. The most noted big game of the Folsom
hunters was <i>Bison antiquus</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_77" href="#fn_7_77">[77]</a></p>
<p>The remaining stage of these &ldquo;middle&rdquo; levels may be
identified&mdash;most arbitrarily&mdash;as the Eden, or parallel-flaked,
point horizon. Fluting of projectile points still
occurs, but the distinctive and exceptional feature is
the beautiful pressure-flaking illustrated on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_155">page 155</a>.
Other types of projectile points include Gypsum,
Plainview, Scottsbluff, Lime Creek, Angostura, and
perhaps Agate Basin. The time span seems to be from
perhaps 7,000 to about 10,000 years ago. The makers of
these points also tended to be bison hunters. <i>Bison occidentalis</i>
may have been the chief game,<a class="fn" id="fr_7_78" href="#fn_7_78">[78]</a> although
there continues occasional association with <i>B. antiquus</i>,
and there begins an identification with <i>B. bison</i>, the
&ldquo;buffalo&rdquo; of Plains Indians in recent times.</p>
<p>In the two thousand years following the Folsom climax&mdash;that
is, from about 7,000 to 9,000 years ago&mdash;notable
transitions occurred in the technologies and
economies of early man. Handsome projectile points
became noticeably diversified in shape, and perhaps in
size. Many continued to be made with a superb craftsmanship
that persisted to historic times. Economically,
as we shall see in <a href="#c10">the next chapter</a>, there was a major
shift of emphasis. This was due in large part to the
great extinction of Pleistocene mammals, which was in
progress by 8,000 years ago and essentially completed
5,000 years ago. During this time, the era of specialized
big-game hunters came to a close. The human populations
that survived seem to have turned their attentions
to the generalized hunting of lesser game. Their economies
were first augmented by, and then focused upon,
<span class="pb" id="Page_182">182</span>
food collecting. For many groups, such as the Indians
of central California, exploitation of wild seeds and
nuts became a specialized and satisfactory means of
subsistence in a climate whose wet winters and dry
summers severely limited agriculture. Elsewhere, seed
collecting was replaced by plant domestication&mdash;an important
first step&mdash;then by plant cultivation and ultimately
by agriculture. Of these late trends in American
prehistory, the scope of this book allows us to touch
on only the Cochise cultures and other seed-collecting
traditions of apparent antiquity.</p>
<h3>Back of 15,000 Years?</h3>
<p>We have hardly mentioned the
earliest period of American prehistory. As in the Old
World, the most ancient is the least known. There are
many places in the west and southwest of the United
States, and some in Mexico and South America, where
materials of what seems impressive antiquity have
been detected. We say materials, rather than cultures,
for they are often suspect.</p>
<p>At Tule Springs, in southern Nevada, for more than
two decades, Southwest Museum archaeologists have
periodically found evidence of what may have been
man-made campfires and the broken, scorched, and
scattered bones of camel, mammoth, bison, and perhaps
horse and sloth. In 1956, Ruth D. Simpson located
<i>in situ</i> &ldquo;a small uniface convex scraper, retouched
along approximately two inches of its circumference&rdquo;
in a pocket of charcoal. From this charcoal, a date of
more than 28,000 years was determined.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_79" href="#fn_7_79">[79]</a> The few
artifacts recovered at Tule Springs are rather nondescript,
but ancient hunters surely occupied the site at
various remote times.</p>
<p>Burned bones of dwarf mammoths on Santa Rosa
Island, off the Santa Barbara coast of southern California,
have furnished radiocarbon dates ranging from
15,000 to about 30,000 years ago. The situation of these
<span class="pb" id="Page_183">183</span>
bones strongly suggests death at the hands of man.
Sure association of cultural materials with the six-foot
elephants has not been determined to the full satisfaction
of archaeologists.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_80" href="#fn_7_80">[80]</a> Although the indicated dates
may be accurate&mdash;and it is not unlikely that these animals
were hunted by early man&mdash;there are other explanations
that are even more plausible.</p>
<p>Near San Diego, California, exposed cliffs with alluvial
deposits and raised sea beaches of presumed
Pleistocene age contain burned places, or fire lenses,
often as much as 100 feet across. George F. Carter believes
these to be hearths dating back to third interglacial
times or earlier.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_81" href="#fn_7_81">[81]</a> As evidence of human occupation,
he has assembled quantities of crudely chipped
cobbles, described as &ldquo;core tools.&rdquo; His critics maintain
that most are even cruder than the lower paleolithic
hand axes of Europe, and refuse to grant that any of
them were made by man.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_82" href="#fn_7_82">[82]</a></p>
<p>Unmistakable artifacts, including types described as
choppers, scrapers, and hand axes, have been found in
abundance in the Mohave Desert, at Pleistocene Lake
Manix<a class="fn" id="fr_7_83" href="#fn_7_83">[83]</a>&mdash;now, like Pleistocene Lake Mohave, a dusty
playa&mdash;and on ancient beaches in nearby Death Valley.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_84" href="#fn_7_84">[84]</a>
The geology of these sites suggests that they may
be of Pleistocene age, but the artifact types and materials
do not differ significantly from those associated
with the Lake Mohave and Silver Lake cultures, for
which dates of less than 10,000 years are considered
probable.</p>
<p>The desert regions of Western America have provided
other sites of apparent Pleistocene age in which
the artifacts are both simple and crudely made. While
it is tempting to consider these as being truly ancient,
we will have to know much more about them before
we can be certain that they are more than the output
of backward desert dwellers such as Father Baegert
described for Baja California in early mission days.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_85" href="#fn_7_85">[85]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_184">184</div>
<p>From other regions of the Americas, there are other
suggestions of early man and ancient cultures. J. L.
Giddings&rsquo; Palisades culture, on mountainside benches
of Cape Krusenstern, Alaska, north of Bering Strait,
may be old. It appears considerably older than the
Denbigh Flint Complex, south of the Strait, which may
go back from 4,500 to 5,000 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_7_86" href="#fn_7_86">[86]</a> And in South
America early man is represented at such sites as El
Jobo, in Venezuela;<a class="fn" id="fr_7_87" href="#fn_7_87">[87]</a> an unpublished radiocarbon
date from this region is rumored at about 16,000 years.</p>
<p>The coming decade should bring further refinements
in radiocarbon dating, as well as the development of
newer techniques such as the Rosholt &ldquo;uranium-daughter&rdquo;
products and obsidian hydration measurements.
With or without the aid of these dating methods,
livelier activity of archaeologists south of the
border should soon give us more information about
early man in Latin America.</p>

<h4><a id="fig64">THE MORE IMPORTANT SITES OF EARLY MAN</a></h4>
<p>The listing on the three next pages, which goes no further than
1948, is not exhaustive. There is room for argument over a number
of the finds; but the arrangement of the materials in columns
provides a rough perspective. The sites are listed in order of
discovery. The symbols indicate one or more occurrences:</p>
<p>Occurrence of the saber-toothed cat, tapir, giant beaver, or extinct
armadillo is not indicated. Finds that seem problematical
or not definitely associated with other finds are shaded. Sandia
points were found with the five extinct mammals indicated in
the Sandia cave and below the Folsom.</p>

<br />EARLY MAN AND THE GREAT EXTINCTION</h2>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0"><i>And prate about an Elephant</i></p>
<p class="t0"><i>Not one of them has seen!</i></p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;<span class="small">J. G. SAXE</span></p>
</div>
<h3>A Twofold Problem</h3>
<p>A mammoth in Colorado ... a
giant sloth near Hoover Dam ... spear points of early
man involved with both. Those two remote and spectacular
animals roaming our own United States set our
minds far back on the trail of time. The weapons, crude
as they were and pitifully small, carry us forward again
tens of thousands of years. We are describing the reaction
of the layman who first learns of these things, but
the opinions of science veer almost as widely when it
tries to date the traffic of man and mammoth in the
New World. The range is from 100,000 years ago to
2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<p>The dating of the life of early man by the death of
mammals now extinct is one of the major tasks that
face the American prehistorian. It is doubly difficult
because, in the first place, evidence of when these animals
died off is only now becoming available, and, secondly,
because we must also know how long man
hunted them <i>before</i> they became extinct. We know
that a few skulls have been found in strata containing
the fossils of these animals, and we know that all but
one of the skulls are longheaded and beetle-browed
like those of the Australians and the Melanesians, instead
of roundheaded like those of most Mongoloids.
We know that Sandia, Clovis, or Folsom points have
been found with the fossils of extinct elephants, horses,
camels, and bison. If we knew when such mammals
became extinct, we should know the latest possible
date of most of the archaic skulls and of Sandia and
Folsom man. But we should still not know just how
much earlier some of these humans lived, or when they
or their predecessors discovered America.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_191">191</div>
<h3>Myths and Mammoths</h3>
<p>The subject has been thoroughly
confused by too many guesses and too little evidence.
Besides a great variety of geologic theories and
some amazingly stubborn conservatism, we have had
some extraordinary Indian myths as well as the dreams
of innocents and eccentrics.</p>
<p>If the Spanish churchmen were a bit upset at finding
in the Indies both a new world and a race unaccounted
for in the Bible, later explorers and settlers of the
mainland were quite as astonished over the discovery
of huge bones in swamps and creeks, prairies and badlands.
Laymen and divines sought explanations, and
of course they found dozens, most of them as absurd
as Cotton Mather&rsquo;s dictum of 1712 that the bones were
those of the giants of Holy Writ. By 1782 Thomas Jefferson
knew they belonged to a kind of elephant, but
on &ldquo;the traditional testimony of the Indians&rdquo; he was
inclined to believe &ldquo;that this animal still exists in the
northern and western parts of America.... He may
as well exist there now as he did formerly where we
find his bones.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_1" href="#fn_8_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>The bridge from sacred fiction to profane fact, from
giants to mammoths and mastodons, seems to have
been the work, oddly enough, of Negro slaves. Mark
Catesby wrote in 1743:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_192">192</div>
<p>At a place in <i>Carolina</i> called <i>Stono</i> was dug out of
the Earth three or four Teeth of a large animal, which
by the concurring Opinion of all the <i>Negroes</i>, native
<i>Africans</i>, that saw them, were the Grinders of an Elephant,
and in my Opinion that could be no other; I
having seen some of the like that are brought from
<i>Africa</i>.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_2" href="#fn_8_2">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the basis of this statement Loren C. Eiseley&mdash;who
has written much on the problem of the extinction of
American mammals&mdash;believes that the Negro slaves
told the Indian as well as the white man about the
animal that had such gigantic bones, and described its
shape and habits.</p>
<p>The eighteenth-century white man&mdash;eager for knowledge
of zoology and many other things&mdash;pumped the
Indian, and doubtless with leading questions. The Indians,
&ldquo;involved in their own vast animal mythology,&rdquo;
as Eiseley puts it, were likely to respond &ldquo;to these myriads
of questions with elaboration and a desire to
please.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_3" href="#fn_8_3">[3]</a> Thus, when our ancestors asked where the
elephants had gone, the Indians answered, &ldquo;Across the
lakes.&rdquo; Soon the belief that the mammoth still lived in
the remoter portions of northeastern Canada grew so
strong in white men that early maps indicated his
home in western Labrador. By the time that the ethnologists
of the last half-century began collecting Indian
myths there were numerous traditions of the elephant
in the native folklore. In a summary of the
material Duncan Strong lists more than a dozen instances.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_4" href="#fn_8_4">[4]</a>
An Algonquin tribe told of a great animal
&ldquo;with an arm coming out of its shoulder,&rdquo; and of another
that left &ldquo;large round tracks in the snow&rdquo; and
&ldquo;struck its enemies with its long nose.&rdquo; Penobscot Indians
had a myth in which a culture hero saw &ldquo;moving
hills without vegetation,&rdquo; which proved to be &ldquo;great
animals with long teeth, animals so huge that when
they lay down they could not get up.&rdquo; There were
<span class="pb" id="Page_193">193</span>
stories of &ldquo;a great moose with a fifth leg.&rdquo; Elephant
myths turned up among the Alabama Indians in the
South. The Chitimacha said: &ldquo;A long time ago a being
with a long nose came out of the ocean and began to
kill people. It would root up trees with its nose to get
at people who sought refuge in the branches.&rdquo; The Eskimos
of Alaska joined their Siberian brothers in tales
of a behemoth that burrowed underground and died
if he breathed air&mdash;a tale derived, no doubt, from the
carcasses of mammoths found frozen under the snow.
&ldquo;These stories,&rdquo; writes Eiseley, &ldquo;show a suspicious
growth in numbers just at the time when White interest
and enthusiasm were keenest.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_5" href="#fn_8_5">[5]</a></p>
<p>Whatever germ of truth may lie in some of the Indian
traditions, certain theorists of the last century and
a half were quite as absurd as Cotton Mather in their
conclusions. In 1806 an Englishman named Thomas
Ashe wrote of &ldquo;incognita, nondescript animals&rdquo; of the
Middle West, and suggested that &ldquo;as the immense volume
of the creature would unfit him for coursing after
his prey through thickets and woods,&rdquo; nature had &ldquo;furnished
him with the power of taking a mighty leap.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_6" href="#fn_8_6">[6]</a>
Then there was John Ranking, who published in 1827
<i>Historical Researches on the Conquest of Peru, Mexico,
Bogota, Natchez, and Talomeco, in the Thirteenth
Century, by the Mongols, Accompanied with Elephants</i>.
Perhaps he was religious enough to believe, like
Jefferson, that &ldquo;no instance can be produced, of her
[nature] having permitted any one race of her animals
to become extinct.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_7" href="#fn_8_7">[7]</a> At any rate, Ranking remembered
the &ldquo;divine wind&rdquo; that balked Kubla Khan&rsquo;s invasion
of Japan, and he allowed it to blow some of Kubla&rsquo;s
vessels to the New World. A son of the Khan became
the first Inca, another Mongol noble founded Montezuma&rsquo;s
line, and the Khan&rsquo;s elephants of war spread
all up and down the two continents&mdash;a notion reported
in 1778 by Johann R. Forster.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_8" href="#fn_8_8">[8]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_194">194</div>
<p>In 1880, worried over how the Mound Builders could
have transported so much earth, Frederick Larkin suggested
that the Indians must have domesticated the
mammoth: &ldquo;We can imagine that tremendous teams
have been driven to and fro in the vicinity of their
great works.&rdquo; As evidence he offered a &ldquo;copper relic&rdquo;
with an elephant engraved on it &ldquo;in harness.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_9" href="#fn_8_9">[9]</a></p>
<h3>Archaeological Evidence of Recent Man and the Mastodon</h3>
<p>The American archaeologist has found no evidence
of the mammoth as a living factor in the life of
the American Indian since the time of Christ. He looks
askance at two elephant pipes of doubtful provenience
which turned up near Davenport, Iowa, around the
eighties. He is not impressed by a carved head, which
might be either elephant or macaw, on a stone stela in
Copan, Honduras. But he must give more respectful
attention to certain evidence concerning the mastodon&mdash;that
early form of elephant which alone of all the
order penetrated to South America and was unknown
in much of the Old World during the Great Ice Age.
Its bones have been found in peat bogs of the Great
Lakes area which formed after the glaciers began to
melt, and a skeleton has been unearthed near Quito,
Ecuador, cheek by jowl with broken pottery.</p>
<p>The South American mastodon was found twelve
miles from Quito in a district where the bones of the
horse, the extinct sloth, and an extinct relative of the
armadillo have also been discovered. Franz Spillman
of the University of Quito made the find, and Max Uhle
cooperated in the excavation. Uhle states that the scientific
facts recorded are beyond question. The animal
lay on his left side, apparently mired in what is now a
yellow clay which lies upon a thick layer of blue clay.
A small landslide had covered the skeleton and the
clay. There were a number of evidences of man. The
ribs of the right side had been cut away. There were
<span class="pb" id="Page_195">195</span>
remains of fire which had been lighted in the belly and
around the feet and tail, and which had baked some
of the clay touching the animal. Spillman and Uhle
found parts of flint artifacts, a shaped bone tool, and
some lengths of wood beside an erect block of stone,
which suggested levers and a fulcrum used in an attempt
to lift portions of the mastodon. They also found&mdash;and
this is the important point so far as dating is
concerned&mdash;more than 150 pieces of broken pottery.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_10" href="#fn_8_10">[10]</a></p>
<p>Eiseley maintains that the site&rsquo;s &ldquo;archaeological neglect
has been scandalous. If this site had been claimed
to be &lsquo;Pleistocene&rsquo; many experts would undoubtedly
have journeyed even to this out-of-the-way location.&rdquo;
Because of the claim that the find was &ldquo;recent,&rdquo; it has
not received the thorough study that a Folsom find
would unquestionably have received in North America.
If the mastodon actually survived until the time of
pottery in South America, says Eiseley, this does not
demonstrate that the animal lingered as late in North
America.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_11" href="#fn_8_11">[11]</a> But it plays hob with the antiquity of a
South American skull from Punin.</p>
<p>There are two curious factors in this discovery. The
first is that coal was found in the remnants of the fire.
Did the Indians of Ecuador use that fuel before the
Spaniards came? Was there a deposit nearer than that
in Peru? The second questionable factor has to do with
the pottery. Although there were no fewer than 152
broken pieces, they could not be fitted into even one
restored pot. Why? Further, 140 of the sherds were
from a primitive type of pottery, imperfectly fired,
while 12 pieces were from an advanced and decorated
type which, in other locations, is supposed to show
Maya influence. Why should two varieties of pottery&mdash;so
widely separated in technique and, presumably, age&mdash;appear
at this one time?</p>

<p class="caption">EIGHT THOUSAND YEARS OF THE GREAT EXTINCTION</p>
<p class="pcapc"><i>More than half of these sixteen mammals seem to have
died out between 10,000 and 8,000 years ago, when the
last glaciers were retreating and early man hunted with
Sandia and fluted points. These latest acceptable dates of
survival in North America are drawn from Jim Hester&rsquo;s
&ldquo;Late Pleistocene Extinction and Radiocarbon Dating,&rdquo; in
American Antiquity for July, 1960. The dates vary in precision
from 150 to &plusmn; 500. There may come later finds.</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_197">197</div>
<p>If the Quito mastodon and pots were indeed neighbors
in time, then they provide the only evidence&mdash;ex
post facto, at that&mdash;for the remarkable statement of the
geologist William B. Scott in 1913: &ldquo;Many Pleistocene
mammals were in existence only a few centuries ago,
in what is called &lsquo;historic time&rsquo; in the Old World. Several
skeletons of the American Mastodon have been
found in bogs, covered by only a few inches of peat,
with more or less of the hair and recognizable contents
of the stomach preserved.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_12" href="#fn_8_12">[12]</a> Eiseley has questioned
the evidence that the mastodon had hair, and he has
pointed out that a peat bog is an ideal place for the
preservation of vegetable matter such as that animal
lived upon.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_13" href="#fn_8_13">[13]</a> The bogs and their fossils lie to the south
of the Great Lakes, which formed as the ice fields began
to retreat into Canada. Since the retreat began
between 10,000 and 12,000 years ago, it is obvious that
bogs could have formed and mastodons been trapped
in them far longer ago than a few centuries&mdash;whether
&ldquo;few&rdquo; means five, ten, or even fifteen.</p>
<p>A hundred years ago Charles Lyell commented on
the profusion of mastodon bones in North American
bogs compared with the paucity of such fossils in the
bogs of Europe; and argued for the late survival of
these animals in the New World.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_14" href="#fn_8_14">[14]</a> Answering him,
Eiseley points out first of all that for many centuries
such skeletons were hunted out and salvaged by Europeans
in search of ivory or the materia medica of the
unicorn&rsquo;s horn. Further, the mastodon, which was a
<span class="pb" id="Page_198">198</span>
forest lover and fell a natural victim to bogs, was almost
unknown to Europe, while the mammoth kept
mainly to dry, open steppes. We know that bogs both
in our Great Lakes area and in northern Europe were
postglacial, &ldquo;and that is all. There exists no evidence,
at present, which seems to demand in the New World
a lingering extinction of the American elephants in a
way much different from the course of events in
Europe.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_15" href="#fn_8_15">[15]</a></p>
<h3>Sloth and Camel in Dry Caves</h3>
<p>When we turn from
the mastodon preserved in wet peat bogs, we come
upon the camel and the sloth in dry caves. There,
buried in dust, are skin, hair, and ligaments, as well as
bone. Not a great deal of such remains exist, however,
and only in a few caves&mdash;and this time &ldquo;few&rdquo; means
less than five. It happens that dry and dust-filled caves
are almost as good embalmers as the bogs of the Great
Lakes or the ice of Siberia and the Alaska muck beds.
&ldquo;In a perfectly dry limestone cave,&rdquo; says Howard, &ldquo;covered
by three to ten feet of dust, there seems to be no
reason why the hair and tissue of the sloth, camel,
horse, or bison could not have been preserved for several
thousands of years.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_16" href="#fn_8_16">[16]</a></p>
<h3>The Folsom Bison Not Extinct?</h3>
<p>Neither elephant nor
sloth, neither horse nor camel, is such a common companion
of the points of Folsom man as is an extinct
form of bison. It was larger than the historic animal,
and had longer and straighter horns. Though it is
known variously as <i>Bison taylori</i>, <i>Bison antiquus antiquus</i>,
and <i>Bison antiquus figgensi</i>, it was probably
of a single type, the last named. Now one of the significant
things about Folsom is that the point never turns
up with the modern variety of buffalo which goes by
the interesting name of <i>Bison bison</i>,<a class="fn" id="fr_8_17" href="#fn_8_17">[17]</a> or even <i>Bison
bison bison</i>&mdash;unless, of course, lack of skull material has
<span class="pb" id="Page_199">199</span>
led scientists astray. Therefore, if we seek the latest
date of Folsom, it would seem as if we must seek the
death day of the extinct bison.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig67">
<img src="images/i053.jpg" alt="" width="596" height="328" />
<p class="pcapc"><i>Prehistoric and modern bison. Above, at the left, is an
outline of typical horn cones of</i> Bison antiquus antiquus,
<i>whose bones have been found with Folsom points. Its horns
were longer and straighter than those of the buffalo of today</i>,
Bison bison, <i>shown at the right. Below is a still larger
and more ancient type</i>, Bison latifrons, <i>with an eighty-inch
span</i>.</p>
</div>
<p>Protagonists of early man have argued that Folsom
must date far, far back, or there would not be time for
the evolution of the modern bison of the High Plains.
Lately, however, Eiseley has developed a theory which
does away with the long period of evolution from <i>Bison
antiquus</i> into <i>Bison bison</i>, and yet pins down Folsom
to the end of the glaciers. There is some evidence that
the kind of bison Folsom man hunted migrated up into
Canada when the glaciers melted, and that the &ldquo;modern&rdquo;
variety, which we call &ldquo;buffalo,&rdquo; came up from
the south and took over the High Plains. As the temperature
moderated over the whole northern hemisphere
the plains of Canada began to resemble the
plains of the United States, where the prey of Folsom
<span class="pb" id="Page_200">200</span>
man had flourished. The climate and the vegetation of
the High Plains, moving north behind the ice, took
<i>Bison antiquus</i> along. The same northward movement
of climate and vegetation occurred from Mexico to the
High Plains, and it carried to their historic habitat the
buffalo that have left their bones in old soils south of
the border. The only place where we meet the two
varieties of bison together is a peat bog in Minnesota.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_18" href="#fn_8_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>The evidence that <i>Bison antiquus</i> moved to Canada
is not complete, but it is suggestive. There are accounts
of bison horns from Athabasca &ldquo;nearly twice the length
of the Plains&rsquo; ones and much straighter.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_19" href="#fn_8_19">[19]</a> Ernest
Thompson Seton provides the same kind of evidence.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_20" href="#fn_8_20">[20]</a>
The Canadian bison and the Folsom variety seem &ldquo;suspiciously
similar,&rdquo; says Eiseley. Unfortunately, in 1925,
before the bison of Athabasca&mdash;the second surviving
race, <i>Bison bison athabasc&aelig;</i>&mdash;had been properly measured
and observed, <i>Bison bison</i> from the High Plains
were brought north to breed with the Canadian variety.
Eiseley feels it is a possibility that the Athabascan
animals &ldquo;represented, at least in a mixed form, the
last of the Ice Age bison which early man had hunted
in the western plains.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_21" href="#fn_8_21">[21]</a> If this is true, it means that
Folsom man was fully developed in the period before
the melting of the glaciers drove his favorite game
north to Canada. It means, further, that he or his immediate
forebears may have entered the plains 50,000
years ago when a corridor opened through the western
ice fields. (See illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_26">page 26</a>.)</p>
<p>The Folsom bison may also have gone northeast to
the edge of New England. Grasslands extend from the
High Plains of the classic Folsom point northeast to
Illinois and Indiana, and ancient steppes once ran
through Ohio to New York State and probably to New
Jersey and southern New England.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_22" href="#fn_8_22">[22]</a> Antevs suggests
that late bands of Folsom men pursued their bison
across this area. Certainly they left their cruder form
<span class="pb" id="Page_201">201</span>
of point in this part of the Middle West and the East.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_23" href="#fn_8_23">[23]</a>
But where, in this area, are the fossils of the extinct
bison?</p>
<h3>The Mystery of Extinction</h3>
<p>A hundred years ago the
French scientist Cuvier, who gave much time to the
study of the fossils of extinct mammals, presented the
&ldquo;cataclysmal&rdquo; explanation of their end. They were destroyed
by sudden great geologic changes. To us, perhaps,
these changes seem to have ignored certain other
animals in a most disquieting way. Cuvier was at a
disadvantage, of course, for he was working in a Bible-ridden
world which had to accept the Book of Genesis
as fact. Even as late as 1887, Henry H. Howorth wrote
in <i>The Mammoth and the Flood</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>These facts ... prove in the first place that a great
catastrophe or cataclysm occurred at the close of the
Mammoth period, by which that animal, with its companions,
were overwhelmed over a very large part of
the earth&rsquo;s surface. Secondly, this cataclysm involved a
very wide-spread flood of water, which not only killed
the animals but also buried them under continuous
beds of loam or gravel. Thirdly, that the same catastrophe
was accompanied by a very great and sudden
change of climate in Siberia, by which the animals
which had previously lived in fairly temperate conditions
were frozen in their flesh underground and have
remained frozen ever since.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_24" href="#fn_8_24">[24]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the hundred years since Koch found a mammoth
and a spear point in Missouri we have learned little
that is definite about the reasons for the extinction of
mammoth, mastodon, camel, horse, sloth, and the rest.
We merely know that they died out as the glaciers began
to melt. The most natural guess for either scientist
or amateur is that change of climate was the lethal
factor. Yet we know that many of them had already
survived drastic changes of climate and lived through
<span class="pb" id="Page_202">202</span>
interglacials as well as glacials in the Great Ice Age.
Further, how do we account for the survival of deer,
antelope, fox, rabbit, moose, beaver, bear, and so many
other animals? How could climate be so selective? If
the dire wolf died, why not the timber wolf? If the
short-faced bear, why not the grizzly? If one form of
rabbit and three forms of antelope, why not all rabbits
and all antelopes? If disease instead of climate was the
great eliminator&mdash;as some have suggested&mdash;we face the
same dilemma.</p>
<p>The mysteries of extinction are so many and so baffling
that it is small wonder no book in English has
been written on the subject. Since 1906, when Henry
Fairfield Osborn summed the matter up in his paper
of fifty-odd pages, &ldquo;The Causes of Extinction of Mammalia,&rdquo;
Eiseley credits only two theories with contributing
anything new to the discussion.</p>
<p>One is the hypothesis of Sewall Wright and his co-workers
that when an animal was greatly reduced in
numbers it would suffer fatally from inbreeding.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_25" href="#fn_8_25">[25]</a>
This, however, leaves us still searching for what reduced
its numbers so radically.</p>
<p>The other theory is Sauer&rsquo;s: Man, the hunter, destroyed
the larger, clumsier, and more gregarious animals
largely by means of fire drives, and these fires
made the grasslands.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_26" href="#fn_8_26">[26]</a> Or, at least, the fire drives
&ldquo;broke the back&rdquo; of mammalian resistance.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_27" href="#fn_8_27">[27]</a> Eiseley
objects on a number of grounds. It was not alone
the large, clumsy, and gregarious animals that disappeared.
Certain mollusks, a variety of toad, a subfamily
of rabbits, the dire wolf, the saber-toothed tiger, three
forms of antelope, the short-faced bear, and a small
horse also disappeared. More damaging still to Sauer&rsquo;s
theory is the fact that a number of birds became extinct.
Eiseley asks, &ldquo;Why, if this method was so deadly,
did the living bison and the living antelope roam the
plains in countless numbers?&rdquo; He points out that, while
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
there is abundant evidence of extinct bison caught and
killed in fire drives, there is no proof of mass kills of
mammoth, horse, camel, and antelope.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_28" href="#fn_8_28">[28]</a> He also mentions
the mastodon, the giant beaver, and the sloth,
which frequented eastern forests or northern bogs and
died in them. &ldquo;Though man was on the scene at the
final perishing, his was not ... the appetite nor the
capacity for such gigantic slaughter.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8_29" href="#fn_8_29">[29]</a> Though Sauer
believes that the numbers of hunting man in the New
World were comparatively large when he killed <i>Bison
antiquus</i>, most authorities disagree. Alfred S. Romer
believes that if man had been numerous enough and
deadly enough to play a major part in the killing, we
should find more evidences of his association with the
extinct mammals.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_30" href="#fn_8_30">[30]</a></p>
<p>Romer and Edwin H. Colbert have put forward another
explanation for the extinction of the mammals.
They suggest that the advent of man in the New
World may have upset a nicely balanced state of nature.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_31" href="#fn_8_31">[31]</a>
But man had been living with just such animals
in the Old World for hundreds of thousands of years
before they became extinct. What, then, destroyed the
mammoth in Europe?</p>
<p>The most pulling of all the fossils of extinct animals
are those in the deep Alaska muck beds. Their numbers
are appalling. They lie frozen in tangled masses,
interspersed with uprooted trees. They seem to have
been torn apart and dismembered and then consolidated
under catastrophic conditions. Eden and Plainview
spear points and perhaps one Clovis have been
found in these chill beds. Skin, ligament, hair, flesh,
can still be seen.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_32" href="#fn_8_32">[32]</a> If scientists can solve this mystery
before the high-pressure water stream of the miner disperses
the evidence, perhaps we shall be nearer solving
one of the greatest and most tantalizing problems involved
in the story of early man&mdash;the date of the extinction
of the great mammals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_204">204</div>
<p>This problem of when the mammoth died should
have puzzled the Old World as well as the New and
caused us to question the dating of Neanderthal and
Cro-Magnon quite as much as Folsom man. Oddly
enough, it did nothing of the kind. In Europe the mammoth
was accepted as diagnostic of the glacial period.
The fact that a Magdalenian man of southern France
sketched a mammoth on the wall of a cave proved that
the man existed in the Great Ice Age. But in America,
if a spear point turned up with the bones of a mammoth,
too many anthropologists accepted it as proof
that the animal died after the ice fields had melted.
The mammoth proved the antiquity of man in Europe;
man proved the modernity of the mammoth in America.
The only shred of evidence to support such reasoning
was the questionable pottery and coal that lay beside
the mastodon bones in Ecuador. We should have
had more and better proof, and we are beginning to
get it.</p>
<h3>More Radiocarbon Dates for Extinct Mammals</h3>
<p>Working
together, archaeologists, paleontologists, and physicists
are providing more and more facts about the
great extinction. Archaeologists are supplying artifacts
for cultural associations, and animal bones that the
paleontologists identify. In radiocarbon laboratories,
the physicists are dating the bones and sometimes
charcoal from man-made fires. Through the evergrowing
list of dates, many early theories are being
replaced with factual knowledge. Some of the dates,
however, must be taken with a grain of sodium chloride.
A single date from a single sample in only one
locality is not too trustworthy. The hazards are obvious,
yet nevertheless we have a fairly large body of facts.
From these, a general impression of the great extinction
is beginning to take shape. As anticipated, man and climate
are involved in the disappearance of the animals.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_205">205</div>
<p>As for climate, a period of much warmer temperatures
followed the end of the last glaciation. This
lasted from about 10,000 to 2,600 years ago. Antevs isolates
the time of highest heat&mdash;the Altithermal&mdash;as
about 7,000 to 4,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_33" href="#fn_8_33">[33]</a> This matches fairly
closely the last dates for our extinct mammals. Heat
and aridity may have driven the larger animals to the
more and more limited watercourses where man himself
would concentrate. Paul S. Martin has noted that
the first large mammals to disappear were those in
Alaska and Mexico, and that they were followed by
the animals of the Plains toward what must have been
the beginning of the hot and dry Altithermal period.
Martin believes that the grazing and browsing mammals
found refuge in the savannas of Florida.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_34" href="#fn_8_34">[34]</a></p>
<p>Working with more than 100 radiocarbon dates concerned
with the great extinction, Jim Hester (no relation
of the junior writer) has brought together results
published through 1959.<a class="fn" id="fr_8_35" href="#fn_8_35">[35]</a> He provides the first reasonably
clear picture of the sequence and magnitude
of lethal events. We see the ancient forms of horse,
camel, and bison, as well as the dire wolf and Columbian
mammoth, beginning to disappear 8,000 years
ago. <i>Bison antiquus</i> lingers later, though Clovis mammoth
hunters may have been active in the Southwest
at the same time that Folsom bison hunters were busy
on the Plains. Hester&rsquo;s summary shows how concerned
man was in the final death of the great mammals. He
lists the last dates for 27 of them. Nine&mdash;one-third&mdash;were
found in archaeological sites of early man; some
others were dated by charcoal that may have come
from fires where he cooked the meat of the great
beasts.</p>

<h3>The Mythical Indian Race</h3>
<p>Science has found a great
many artifacts and a few skulls that seem to have belonged
to early man. Was he an Indian? Was he a
Paleo-Indian&mdash;whatever that may imply? Was he a
Mongoloid with an admixture of Australoid, Negroid,
and White? Was he Mongoloid at all?</p>
<p>Among the most blatant misnomers of popular science
is &ldquo;Indian race.&rdquo; Even in North America it is an
absurdity. Throw in Middle America and South America,
and the attempt to fit the people of the New World
into this or any one racial pigeonhole becomes laughable.
Living Indians of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; breed show an immense
variety in all physical features except their eyes, their
hair, their cheekbones, and their upper front teeth.
Some of their skulls and some of the skulls of their dead&mdash;particularly
those that belonged to early man&mdash;show
marked differences from those of the Mongoloid race
of which the Indians are all commonly supposed to be
a part. The differences are so marked that some of our
physical anthropologists believe that other races than
the Mongoloid contributed to the discovery and settlement
of the Americas. They see at least one and possibly
three such contributions. If we discount transpacific
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
migration, we must accept the fact that all the
peoples of northern Asia did not always belong to the
now ubiquitous Mongoloid races. Of this, more at the
end of the chapter.</p>
<p>The Mongoloid racial stock has five physical traits
that occur with high frequency, which means that in
any mixture with another race, five traits seem likely
to be transmitted to immediate descendants. One trait
is the peculiar shovel shape of the upper incisor, or
front, teeth. The second is brown eyes. The third is
straight black hair. The fourth is prominent cheekbones,
or malars. A fifth is the so-called Mongoloid
spot, a purplish discoloration appearing at the base of
the spine shortly after birth. It persists for a few years,
gradually becoming indistinct before adolescence. Of
course, there are minor irregularities. Not all the millions
of incisors of our Indians are shovel-shaped. The
wavy hair of the Lacandon Indians of southern Mexico
may have a reddish tinge. But the great majority of
New World Indians share these traits, including prominent
cheekbones, and, by so much, they share also a
very considerable amount of Mongoloid ancestry.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig68">

<p class="pcapc"><i>The eye of a Chinese with the Mongoloid fold, contrasted
with the eye of a white man. (After Hooton, 1931.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>In addition, there are many traits typical of Asiatic
Mongoloids which appear very irregularly in the
Americas. The &ldquo;Mongoloid fold&rdquo;&mdash;an overhanging fold
of skin on the upper eyelid&mdash;is found in some tribes and
not in others, and in certain individuals of a tribe and
not in others. The bony structure of the face varies
greatly. Some tribes have strong chins; some, weak
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
ones. The nose of the typical Plains Indian is hawklike&mdash;a
violent departure from the Mongoloid&rsquo;s rather flat
nasal equipment. The &ldquo;Semitic&rdquo; nose of the Maya is
Japanese but not at all Chinese. &ldquo;The Indian type,&rdquo;
says Nelson, &ldquo;is distinguishable in one way or another
from its nearest Mongoloid relations, and at the same
time is separable according to some authorities into
about ten more or less distinct varieties.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_1" href="#fn_9_1">[1]</a></p>
<p>Looked at in terms of resemblances to Old World
peoples, the American Indian becomes a very crazy
quilt of races. Hooton sees &ldquo;an almost pre-Dravidian
look&rdquo; about the Lacandons which vaguely reminds him
of the Veddas of India. He finds that many Indians of
the Northwest coast resemble Alpine Europeans, and
that eastern Indians have a &ldquo;European look,&rdquo; and are
&ldquo;by no means as Mongoloid as the Plains and Southwestern
Indians&rdquo;:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For years I have been troubled by the types depicted
in the splendid series of oil portraits of Indians
in the Peabody Museum. The most of these represent
Indians of the eastern and southeastern United States,
and, although the portraits are the work of an excellent
painter, his subjects look very European. The features
of most are very un-Mongoloid, with prominent
noses and oval faces ... some Plains Indians are included
in the series, and these seem to be accurate
representations of types familiar today. I am, therefore,
disposed to think that the European-like types
are not the result of an artistic convention, but actually
did exist.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_2" href="#fn_9_2">[2]</a></p>

<h3>Racial Definition&mdash;the Field of the Physical Anthropologist</h3>
<p>Physical anthropology has its difficulties and uncertainties
when it tries to reach back deep into time.
But the tests by which it distinguishes races seem as
sound and dependable as those of any of the disciplines
that deal with early man. Some of the results are certainly
striking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_210">210</div>
<p>There are problems, of course, as to the order in
which the various races developed and spread throughout
the Old World. In the opinion of some authorities,
the Pygmy, or Negrito, came first. The Pygmy, although
resembling the Negro in most respects, has in
general one of the roundest heads of all mankind, while
the Negro&rsquo;s is pre-eminently long and narrow. Many
anthropologists pick the Australoid as the second race
to leave an unknown homeland and spread far abroad.
The White, or Caucasoid, racial stock is divided into
certain groups by one authority, and into other groups
by another. Hooton puts the beginnings of the White
race far back by calling the Australoid &ldquo;an archaic form
of modern White man.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_3" href="#fn_9_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>But, in spite of conflicts of opinion, the physical anthropologist
has fairly firm ground to stand on. He can
bring to bear on the skull or the fleshed bone of man
certain tests, certain measurements, which enable him
to discriminate with some accuracy between the various
racial types. The most important of the measurements
have to do with the shape of the head and certain
of its features.</p>
<h3>The Cephalic Index&mdash;and Others</h3>
<p>A hundred years
ago a Swedish scientist, Anders Retzius, set up a measurement
called the cephalic index, which indicates
whether a head is dolichocephalic or brachycephalic&mdash;long-headed
or round-headed, narrow or broad. The
width of the skull, divided by its length, and multiplied
by 100, gives the cephalic index&mdash;as 15.0 cm. &divide;
17.6 cm. &times; 100 = 85.23. The long-headed, or dolichocephalic,
skull, lies below 75; the round-headed, or
brachycephalic, at or above 80. Between lies the intermediate
ground of the mesocephalic. (It is rather
easy to keep &ldquo;dolichocephalic&rdquo; and &ldquo;brachycephalic&rdquo;
straight if you note that the longer word applies to the
long-headed skulls.)</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_211">211</div>
<p>The Pygmy aside, we find long-headedness common
to early peoples and then gradually giving way to
round-headedness. Round-headedness is a progressively
modern tendency; there seem to be more round
heads than there used to be. (Round-headedness
seems to have increased sharply with the advent of
agriculture. Are the two related? Does a vegetable diet
have a functional effect upon head shape?) Among
modern peoples, the Australian, the Negro, the Nordic,
and the Mediterranean are long-headed. The Pygmy,
the Alpine of Central Europe, and the Chinese are
generally round-headed. Most Indians, being heavily
Mongoloid, are likewise round-headed. The cephalic
index alone is not too good a means of determining
races today, but it has definite value in dealing with
early man in the Americas. Here, as in the Old World,
he seems to have been, with two exceptions, as long-headed
as the modern Australian.</p>

&ldquo;broad-headed&rdquo; for &ldquo;round-headed.&rdquo; (After Taylor, 1937,
with some modifications.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>There are other important measurements, which we
shall not describe at such length. The facial index tells
us whether the face is relatively broad or narrow, the
breadth is measured from cheekbone to cheekbone,
and the length from the root, or topmost point, of the
nose between the eyes to the bottom of the chin. This
facial index is not so useful as the cephalic in determining
race, because some of the bones involved are
affected by age and sex. The nasal index tells us
whether the nose&mdash;or, in a skull, the nasal aperture&mdash;is
broad or narrow, adapted to a warm, moist climate
or to a dry, cold one. Then there is the matter of prognathism,
with a receding chin. Heavy brow ridges,
which usually go with a retreating forehead, and the
shape of the vault may be important indications of
race. No one of these measurements or observations
<span class="pb" id="Page_213">213</span>
can definitely denote race, but a number of them taken
together are rather reliable.</p>
<p>There is a certain difficulty, however, in applying the
detective methods of physical anthropology to the
skulls of early man in the New World. It is only a matter
of terminology, but sometimes this affects our understanding
of what scientists are talking about when
they describe early American skulls as Australoid, Melanesian,
Papuan, Caucasoid, or Negroid. The difficulty
stems back to the southwest Pacific. The Australians&mdash;a
race as primitive as the Neanderthal and perhaps
more primitive&mdash;are spoken of as Australoid. They are
also described by some writers as Caucasoid on the
theory that they are a blend of an archaic white race
with Negroid elements. The dark-skinned people, who
inhabit large parts of New Guinea and nearby islands,
are called Melanesian. Some of the men of this area
used to be called Papuan&mdash;which is really only a word
for a language. When the characteristics of their skulls
turn up in the Americas, these craniums may be called
Papuan by an older writer or Australoid, Melanesian,
Caucasoid, or Negroid. Recently, physical anthropologists
have determined that no full-sized Negro has
existed east of, roughly, Arabia until recent times. Accordingly,
this Negroid element in the western Pacific
must be related to the Pygmy. We will refer to him as
Oceanic Negrito.</p>
<p>What do the tests of the physical anthropologist tell
you about skulls which come from the southwest Pacific
or resemble specimens from that area? If you find a
skull that has protruding jaws, a low or depressed nose
root, and straight sides, you may say with some assurance
that it belonged to an Oceanic Negrito, an aboriginal
Australian, an Australoid-Melanesian, or&mdash;if the
owner has been dead many thousands of years&mdash;an
Australoid. If the skull also has a heavy, continuous
brow ridge, a retreating forehead, and a low, keeled
vault, you can forget the Negrito. The man was an
Australoid-Melanesian, or an Australoid.</p>

<h3>What Skull Measurements Tell Us About Early Man</h3>
<p>These peculiarities of southwest Pacific skulls are important
if you are looking for early man in the Americas.
As we have said, a skull found along with the bones
of extinct mammals or in a geological formation that
suggests great age is almost always long-headed, or
dolichocephalic. The typical, round-headed Mongoloid
Indian is conspicuous by his antique absence. (The
only early skulls that are not long-headed fall in the intermediate
division, the mesocephalic.) Further, the
early skull has most, if not all, of the following features:
a heavy, almost continuous brow ridge; a receding
chin; a low nose root; straight sides; a retreating
forehead, and a keeled vault.</p>
<p>On the score of long-headedness, there can be no
question about all but two of the early skulls mentioned
in <a href="#c8">Chapter 6</a> or illustrated on <a class="pgref" href="#Page_216">page 216</a>. The Confins
has a cephalic index of 69.1, which is hyper-dolichocephalic,
or extra long; the female skulls of the Peric&uacute;
in Lower California average 68.50 and the male 66.15,
while sixteen skulls from the Texas coast show an average
of 65.37. Except for the skulls of Tepexpan man
and the Minnesota girl, all the other skulls we have
referred to have the same long-headed character. If
those from Texas and the Pacific Coast are not so ancient
as the rest, at least they seem to represent the
descendants of an old strain forced off into marginal
areas by the invasion of newer peoples. To be sure, we
have now&mdash;and have had&mdash;Indians with long skulls,
particularly in the eastern part of the United States
and to some extent on the Great Plains. But their number
is not large, and can never have been large, compared
with the great bulk of round-headed Indians of
the two Americas.</p>

<p>Apart from long-headedness, our early skulls share
a number of other peculiarities of the Australoid-Melanesian:
the quite heavy brow ridges, the keeled
vault, the straight sides, the retreating forehead, the
low nose root, and the receding chin. Some have the
round vault and the fuller forehead of White and Mongoloid
peoples, but these are also a feature of the
Negrito strain that united with the Australoid in
Melanesia.</p>
<p>In one respect only do the skulls of early American
man follow a Mongoloid pattern: almost all have prominent
cheekbones. We must remember, however, that
prominent cheekbones are found in other races&mdash;though
not so commonly&mdash;and we must recognize that
they cannot weigh too heavily against those un-Mongoloid
peculiarities we have dwelt on.</p>
<p>The peculiarities of our early skulls must make
us think twice about the Indian as the only pre-Columbian
inhabitant of the Americas south of the Eskimo.
They bear witness to another invader from the
Old World. Such skulls&mdash;even if they were only a thousand
years old&mdash;would tell us that the typical Mongoloid
Indian was not the only arrival from Asia who left
descendants. Since many of the skulls are definitely the
<span class="pb" id="Page_218">218</span>
oldest that have been found in the New World, we
must recognize that early man bore some relationship
to other peoples than the forebears of the noble red
man.</p>
<h3>Europe Recognizes the Australoid in America</h3>
<p>The earliest recognition of non-Indian traits in the Americas
came from scientists of the Old World&mdash;Mochi, Biasutti,
Hansen, Quatrefages, ten Kate (who found the Peric&uacute;
skulls in Lower California), Rivet, Gusinde, Lebzelter,
Mendes Corre&acirc;, Hultkrantz. The first American and
British students to accept the idea were Roland B.
Dixon in 1923, A. C. Haddon in 1925, and Sir Arthur
Keith and Earnest A. Hooton in 1930; the last two were
physical anthropologists, and naturally knew more
than archaeologists about the meaning of bones. Toward
the end, even Hrdli&#269;ka was diluting the Mongolism
of the Indian with some Aurignacian and Magdalenian
ancestry, though the Australoid and the
Melanesian were too much for him.</p>
<p>In the English-speaking world the case for the Mongoloid
Indian as the only type of early man was definitely
and finally thrown out of court in 1930 by statements
from two men eminent in their field&mdash;Keith and
Hooton.</p>
<p>Keith&rsquo;s statement was simple and short, but his position
as a sound and skillful anatomist gave it considerable
weight. He confirmed the judgment of Louis
R. Sullivan and Milo Hellman that the Punin skull from
Ecuador resembled the skulls of native women of Australia.
The points of resemblance, he wrote, &ldquo;were too
numerous to permit us to suppose that the skull could
be a sport produced by an American Indian parentage.&rdquo;
Here follows Keith&rsquo;s decisive dictum: &ldquo;This discovery
at Punin does compel us to look into the possibility
of a Pleistocene Glacial invasion of America by
an Australoid people.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_4" href="#fn_9_4">[4]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<h3>Hooton and Dixon on Early Invaders</h3>
<p>Hooton&rsquo;s pronouncement
in 1930 against the pretensions of the
Mongoloid Indian resulted from a study of a number
of old skulls found at Pecos Pueblo in New Mexico. In
terms of early man they were not so very aged; in fact,
they were slightly younger than the Basket Makers of
the first Christian centuries. But in these skulls Hooton
found traces of seven types of men. They included, as
one might expect, the Basket Makers, the Plains Indian,
and a &ldquo;large hybrid&rdquo; type which was thoroughly
Indian. In addition he listed a &ldquo;Pseudo-Australoid,&rdquo; a
&ldquo;Pseudo-Negroid,&rdquo; a &ldquo;Long-faced European,&rdquo; and a
&ldquo;Pseudo-Alpine&rdquo; type. From this analysis of skulls little
more than a thousand years old, Hooton went on boldly
to picture the kind of men that first discovered and
invaded the Americas:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Briefly, then, my present opinion as to the peopling
of the American continent is as follows: At a rather
remote period, probably soon after the last glacial retreat,
there straggled into the New World from Asia
by way of the Bering Strait groups of dolichocephals
in which were blended at least three strains: one very
closely allied to the fundamental brunet European and
African long-headed stock called &ldquo;Mediterranean&rdquo;; another,
a more primitive form with heavy brow-ridges,
low broad face and wide nose, which is probably to
be identified with an archaic type represented today
very strongly (although mixed with other elements) in
the native Australians, and less strongly in the so-called
&ldquo;Pre-Dravidians&rdquo; such as the Veddahs, and also in the
Ainu; thirdly, an element certainly Negroid (not Negro).
These people, already racially mixed, spread
over the New World carrying with them a primitive
fishing and hunting culture. Their coming must have
preceded the occupation of eastern Asia by the present
predominantly Mongoloid peoples, since the purer
<span class="pb" id="Page_220">220</span>
types of these dolichocephals do not show the characteristic
Mongoloid features.</p>
<p>At a somewhat later period there began to arrive in
the New World groups of Mongoloids coming by the
same route as their predecessors. Many of these were
probably purely Mongoloid in race, but others were
mixed with some other racial element notable because
of its high-bridged and often convex nose. This may
have been either Armenoid or Proto-Nordic (or neither
one). These later invaders were capable of higher cultural
development than the early pioneers and were
responsible for the development of agriculture and for
the notable achievements of the New World civilization.
In some places they may have driven out and
supplanted the early long-heads, but often they seem
to have interbred with them producing the multiple
and varied types of the present American Indians&mdash;types
which are Mongoloid to a varying extent, but
never purely Mongoloid. Last of all came the Eskimo,
a culturally primitive Mongoloid group, already mixed
with some non-Mongoloid strain before their arrival in
North America.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_5" href="#fn_9_5">[5]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In 1947 Hooton stated this in simpler terms: &ldquo;I am
fairly sure that the earliest arrivals here were non-Mongoloids
carrying archaic White strains (&lsquo;Australoids,&rsquo;
if you like) probably mixed with Negritic elements
and with whatever else was kicking around in
Asia before they crossed Bering Strait.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_6" href="#fn_9_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>Dixon&rsquo;s position, which he took in 1923, is in some
ways a more radical one than Hooton&rsquo;s. He introduces
&ldquo;Proto-Australoid,&rdquo; &ldquo;Proto-Negroid,&rdquo; and Mediterranean
elements, and also Caspian and Alpine; but,
where Hooton recognizes a general stock in which Australoid,
Negroid, and Mediterranean were blended before
their arrival, Dixon brings in his races separate
and pure, and he assigns them definite areas in the
New World.</p>
<p>Dixon&rsquo;s Proto-Australoid originated in tropical southeast
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
Asia. It spread westward &ldquo;through India and the
Arabian coasts to Africa, and by way of the Mediterranean
passed into western Europe, where it appeared
in early Paleolithic times.... Another branch spread
southeast into Australia, where its early presence is
proved by the Talgai skull,&rdquo; perhaps 150,000 years old.
&ldquo;A third branch drifted slowly northward up the eastern
Asiatic littoral, and, crossing into America, spread
thinly through the continents, and perhaps mainly
along the western shores.... On the Pacific Coast in
California and Lower California it appears to constitute
the oldest stratum, characterizing as it does the
crania from the lower layers of the shell-heaps, from
the islands of Santa Catalina and San Clemente off the
Coast, and from the extinct Pericue [now Peric&uacute;] isolated
on the southern tip of the peninsula of Lower
California.&rdquo; Dixon places some of his Proto-Australoids
among the ancestors of the Iroquois and the southern
Algonquin tribes of the East. He puts most of his Proto-Negroids
in that same eastern area and with the same
tribes. He finds them generally east of the Rockies, but
also among the Basket Makers in the Southwest and
the peoples of the Coahuila Caves of northern Mexico,
in the Lagoa Santa area in Brazil, and in Patagonia.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_7" href="#fn_9_7">[7]</a></p>
<p>Two of the White types&mdash;the Caspian and the Mediterranean&mdash;seem
rather scattered and rather early.
Dixon thinks that a Caspian strain may have appeared
as soon as the Proto-Australoid, perhaps sooner. It
crops up among the Eskimo and at spots in British
Columbia, and widely in South America. The Mediterranean
influence, Dixon says, is found also among the
Eskimo and among Shoshonean and Siouan tribes.</p>
<p>Dixon does not think much of the Mongoloids. Believing
they were a very old people that drifted into
Europe in early paleolithic times, he says they &ldquo;contributed
little of value either to the sum of human
achievements or the blood of existing races.&rdquo; He gives
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
them only scant space in North America. Instead he
introduces two other round-headed peoples. They are
first the Paleo-Alpines, and later the Alpines. These,
who seem to take on the role played by the Mongoloids
of Hooton and others, spread through to South America
and &ldquo;displayed striking ability.... To them seems to
be attributable most of the higher achievements of the
aboriginal American peoples.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_8" href="#fn_9_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>Some theories are doubtless much too simple; also,
they depend too much on other theories, such as the
idea that all the races originated in southwestern Asia.
R. Ruggles Gates, who writes of &ldquo;American Neanderthaloids&rdquo;
and &ldquo;pseudo-Australoids,&rdquo; believes that the
craniums of the men of Lagoa Santa and Punin&mdash;&ldquo;the
earliest wave of interglacial Americans&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;represent a
parallel stage in skull development of a widely different
race&rdquo; from the one that began as the Neanderthal
or the one that ended as the Australian.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_9" href="#fn_9_9">[9]</a></p>
<h3>A Potpourri of Races</h3>
<p>The theories of Dixon and Hooton
and others conflict in many places; but they present,
on the whole, an arresting and convincing case
for early man as a predecessor of the Mongoloids and
as quite a different sort of creature. There are many
side issues to the general theory, and they increase as
we begin to deal with living peoples. Hooton finds
close resemblances to Egyptian skulls among the Arizona
Basket Makers and in the Coahuila Caves of
northern Mexico,<a class="fn" id="fr_9_10" href="#fn_9_10">[10]</a> and Dixon identifies ancient Egyptian
skulls with skulls from California and skulls of the
Iroquois. W. W. Howells sees similarities between
&ldquo;many forest tribes of South America and certain Indonesian
groups in Borneo and the Philippines,&rdquo; and
believes the non-Mongoloid features of the Indians
point, &ldquo;not to the Australoids or the Negroes, but towards
the White group.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_11" href="#fn_9_11">[11]</a> Hooton finds Indians of
the Northwest coast who &ldquo;resemble Alpine Europeans.&rdquo;
<span class="pb" id="Page_223">223</span>
He says that certain Plains Indians seem to be
basically White with Mongoloid added, and he points
out that although the Eskimo are the most Mongoloid
of all the inhabitants of the Americas, they are long-headed,
which is a most un-Monogoloid trait.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_12" href="#fn_9_12">[12]</a> On the
basis of skulls from Chancelade, France, and certain
late-paleolithic traits, Sollas saw the ancestors of the
Eskimo living in Europe in Magdalenian times.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_13" href="#fn_9_13">[13]</a>
M. R. Harrington also picks a Magdalenian forebear
for the Eskimo.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_14" href="#fn_9_14">[14]</a> Authorities differ as to whether the
Botocudo tribe of Brazil is descended from the people
that left their skulls in the Lagoa Santa caves, but on
the basis of R. N. Wegners description of a Bolivian
tribe, the Qurunga, Griffith Taylor believes these people
may be living representatives of an early Australoid
migration.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_15" href="#fn_9_15">[15]</a> Hooton puts forward the picturesque
and amusing theory that the Maya, with their large,
curved noses and their mania for flattening their heads
between boards, picked up both the nose and the
mania from the Armenoids of the Iranian plateau. The
Mongoloids provided the characteristic skin, hair, and
eyelids.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_16" href="#fn_9_16">[16]</a></p>
<p>The backwardness of certain living American tribes
suggests to Sauer that they came to the New World a
very long time ago. Their lack of a number of useful
skills argues that they branched off from the men of
the Old Stone Age when the Australoid ancestors of
the abysmal Blackfellows of Australia looked like an
up-and-coming people. These early men had the enterprise
to reach the New World, but they stuck to old
and limited habits of life. They would not learn from
new invading peoples, and so they were forced into
refuge areas as remote as Newfoundland, Lower California,
Amazonia, and Tierra del Fuego. As an example
of cultural backwardness and of an inability to learn
which recalls the Australians, Sauer cites a people in
the Brazilian interior who get along without boiling any
<span class="pb" id="Page_224">224</span>
of their food. He believes that this tribe acquired its
cultural habits in the days before man began to put
heated stones into water in pitch-sealed baskets. The
primitive resistance of these &ldquo;Indians&rdquo; to borrowing
new cooking skills like boiling comes out in other directions.
&ldquo;Long in contact with pottery-making peoples,
they make casual or no use of pots, but restrict their
cooking to roasting and baking, with gourds, a late acquisition,
used for carrying water.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_17" href="#fn_9_17">[17]</a></p>
<p>Griffith Taylor once wrote to Earl W. Count that,
because certain of the now extinct mammals inhabited
both sides of Bering Strait in the days of the glaciers,
&ldquo;it is almost impossible that the Australoids (who
preyed on them) did not cross into America in Pre-W&uuml;rm
times.&rdquo; Count supports Taylor with the suggestion
that the most primitive of the many stocks that
invaded the Americas came &ldquo;at a time, say, when
Talgai man and Wadjak man were en route to their
<i>cul de sac</i> in Australia.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_18" href="#fn_9_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Radical as these last two suggestions are in point of
time, they are conservative compared with theories
held by A. A. Mendes Corre&acirc; and Paul Rivet. Like
many another student, Mendes Corre&acirc; saw Australian,
Caucasoid, Polynesian, Melanesian, and Asiatic affinities
among the American Indians; but he struck into a
new field of theory in 1926 by transporting the Australians
to South America over a now-vanished land-bridge
to the south. Using Wegener&rsquo;s hypothesis of the
drift of continents, he found his bridge in a severed
and displaced Antarctica. He conceded that this was
only a conjecture, but thought it &ldquo;very probable.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_19" href="#fn_9_19">[19]</a>
That same year Rivet&mdash;approving migrations of Australian,
Malayan-Polynesian, Asiatic, and Ural elements&mdash;suggested
that glaciation in the southern hemisphere
might have aided the Australians in passing from
island to island until they reached the mainland of
South America.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_20" href="#fn_9_20">[20]</a> He dated their journey at only 6,000
<span class="pb" id="Page_225">225</span>
years ago,<a class="fn" id="fr_9_21" href="#fn_9_21">[21]</a> so that glacial assistance beyond the present
extent of Antarctica seems just a little unlikely.
Rivet, following many a student from Leibnitz to
Thomas Jefferson, proposed to trace the origin of the
American peoples through comparing their languages
with those of the Old World. In 1925 he came up with
something more than the usual random identities between
words.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_22" href="#fn_9_22">[22]</a> Indeed, the parallels which he drew
between the present speech of the Tshon of Patagonia
and the Australians seemed to Dixon to be impossibly
close after centuries upon centuries of separation from
one another and of contact with other peoples.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_23" href="#fn_9_23">[23]</a> Only
sheer coincidence could account for such identity.</p>
<p>There remain two champions of multiform and multitudinous
migrations&mdash;Jos&eacute; Imbelloni of Argentina and
Harold S. Gladwin. They go further than any of their
predecessors in peopling the New World with varied
races, and further in advancing transpacific migrations
as an important factor in the history of the Americas.</p>
<h3>Pygmies Before Australoids in the New World?</h3>
<p>Both
Imbelloni and Gladwin begin with a suggestion that
Pygmies deserve consideration. These primordial migrants
trod their tiny paces from some unknown fatherland
to the forests of the Congo and the jungles of New
Guinea, to islands like the Andamans and possibly to
Tasmania. The presence of five-foot Yahgan in Tierra
del Fuego suggests to both Imbelloni and Gladwin that
Pygmies may have preceded the Australoids to the
New World. The advent of Pygmies in Tierra del
Fuego as well as in Tasmania may be open to question;
for in both places the natives, though short, exceeded
the average of Pygmy height by a few inches, and their
heads, instead of being round like those of the Pygmies,
are recorded as of medium cephalic index.</p>
<p>After the Tasmanian strain, Imbelloni carries over by
<span class="pb" id="Page_226">226</span>
land a Melanesian type to lay their skulls in Lagoa
Santa, Punin, Texas, and Lower California. Next came
tall people, &ldquo;comparable partly to the Australian type,&rdquo;
who seem to be the Indians of plains and pampas.
These were the last of the land-borne migrants until
the present era. Hereafter they came by sea. The
fourth element was a Proto-Indonesian people that settled
exclusively in South America and mainly in Amazonia.
With the fifth group Imbelloni presents the first
frank Mongoloids, round-headed and inclined to agriculture;
they settled in the Southwest, in Middle America,
and along the Andean coast. An almost identical
people&mdash;whom Imbelloni calls the Isthmid&mdash;spread
through the center of the same area shortly after the
birth of Christ and brought to fruition the civilizations
which Cortez and Pizarro found in the New World. To
top off his list, Imbelloni brings over the Eskimo and
men for the American Northwest&mdash;but by no longer
a sea voyage than Bering Strait.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_24" href="#fn_9_24">[24]</a></p>
<p>Gladwin&rsquo;s theories appeared first in the second volume
of <i>Excavations at Snaketown</i>, and were presented
in altered and amplified form through his rather
antic book <i>Men Out of Asia</i>. They are completely heretical,
completely fascinating, and in some respects
uncommonly plausible. They are certainly a tonic.</p>
<p>Gladwin begins with what might be called a Pygmoid
visitation. He does not dignify it with the word
&ldquo;migration.&rdquo; He is careful to say that there are only
&ldquo;rather vague indications.&rdquo; There is &ldquo;just enough to
make one wonder if there may not have been a few
Pygmy groups who strayed over here long, long ago
and were pushed off to the edges and the ends when
the Australoid tide flowed in.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_25" href="#fn_9_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>If a scientific study is ever made in the Guayana
highlands of Venezuela, some support may be given
to the theory of an early Pygmy migration. Carl Sauer
on a visit to Venezuela in 1946 saw photographs of a
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
Pygmy-like people taken by a Venezuelan army officer
who had paddled and packed the Guayana River for
some years. This tribe, which does not interbreed with
other tribes, appears to be Pygmoid in stature and
type. Further, it lacks &ldquo;clothing, weaving, netting,
baskets, boats, and fishing skills, and also houses.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_9_26" href="#fn_9_26">[26]</a></p>
<h3>Australoids, Negroids, and Men from Europe</h3>
<p>Gladwin
is definite about the Australoids. They came over
Bering Strait somewhere around 25,000 years ago, and
drifted down the west coast. They spread out in the
southwestern part of the United States below a line
from San Francisco to the Texas coast, and flowed on
down into Mexico and South America. For evidence
he has more than the Australoid-Melanesian skulls of
Lower California, Texas, Punin, Paltacalo, and Lagoa
Santa. He cites a number of things used and made by
the Australians of recent times and also found in the
area between southern California and eastern Texas.
They include an Aurignacian flint industry, bunt points
for darts, bull-roarers, string made by spinning human
hair, twisted rabbit fur, curved throwing sticks with
parallel grooves, sand paintings, amputation of finger
joints as shown in pictographs, and similarities in spear-throwers
and darts with foreshafts (see illustration,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_228">page 228</a>).<a class="fn" id="fr_9_27" href="#fn_9_27">[27]</a> We should like to find them nearer Lagoa
Santa.</p>
<p>Gladwin&rsquo;s next migration, the Proto-Negroid of
Dixon, leans upon the Pseudo-Negroid traits of Hooton.
It comes in about 17,000 years ago, also over Bering
Strait, but down through the corridor between the retreating
ice fields of western Canada. Having seen
Aurignacian qualities in the Australoids, Gladwin sees
Solutrean ones in the Negroid invaders. They bring&mdash;or,
rather, make&mdash;the Folsom point. Unlike the Australoids,
who were mostly food gatherers, the Negroids&mdash;or
Folsom men&mdash;are primarily hunters. Although they
come trickling in for many, many years, they are few;
for, in spite of their hunting prowess and their fine flint
knives and spear points, they never invade the Australoid
territory that is staked out south from the Mexican
border.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_28" href="#fn_9_28">[28]</a></p>

<p>The next migration is the Algonquin. It reaches
North America somewhere between 1000 and 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>
These people bring in the cord-marked pottery of the
Woodland culture of the eastern United States&mdash;unpolished
and unpainted, its only ornament impressed in
the clay. Such pottery has now been traced to western
Canada, up into Alaska, across to Siberia, west through
Russia to the beakerwares of Europe, and finally down
into Africa about 3000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> The Algonquins are such a
mixture as the long trip of their pottery might indicate.
They are generally long-headed, and they are not today
wholly Mongoloid.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_29" href="#fn_9_29">[29]</a></p>
<h3>No Mongoloids till 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span></h3>
<p>The first Mongoloids, as
Gladwin sees it, were the Eskimos. They came to the
northern edge of North America about 500 <span class="small">B.C.</span> But,
because they clung to that edge, we must look elsewhere
and later for a Mongoloid invasion of the cultural
areas of the New World.</p>
<p>Gladwin believes that these second Mongoloids were
thrust out of northern China and on into the New
World by the ferment of the Huns. They reached
Alaska about 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span> Ultimately, supplemented by the
Uto-Aztecans, they supplied the man power on which
the Mexican and Maya civilizations were built; and
some reached the west coast of South America.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_30" href="#fn_9_30">[30]</a>
Without a good many of them it seems to us difficult
to account for such Andean peoples as the speakers of
the Quechua and Aymara languages, who were the
working population of the Chimu, Nasca, Tiahuanaco,
and Inca cultures. By Gladwin&rsquo;s dating, the Mongoloids
had only a little more than a thousand years to
<span class="pb" id="Page_230">230</span>
stamp their hair and eyes and teeth upon five million
to fifty million men and women in both Americas.</p>
<p>By the time of the Algonquin&mdash;let alone the Eskimo
and the Aztec&mdash;we are far out of the era of early man.
But we are not yet through with the theories of Gladwin
as to the peopling of the Americas; for, not content
with the stimulating activities of the Huns in
northern China, he rediscovers the sailors and the Asiatic
fleet of the late, great conqueror Alexander of
Macedon, and leads them on expeditions through the
East Indies and Oceania even to the Gulf of Darien.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_31" href="#fn_9_31">[31]</a></p>
<p>However heretical Gladwin&rsquo;s suggestions may be,
they deserve serious attention if only because they bear
heavily upon an old quarrel of the archaeologists, and
because this old quarrel bears upon the antiquity of
man in the Americas. To be sure, it has to do with the
Indians who made the civilizations of Middle America
and Peru two thousand years ago, and not with the
earlier men who did no more than hunt or gather, and
who made nothing more remarkable than Folsom and
Eden points or milling stones. But by studying certain
aspects of those civilizations we may recognize that the
Indians had been in the Americas 3,000 to 5,000 years
before Columbus. By so much we may reenforce the
theory that their forerunners or their forebears came to
the New World at least 15,000 years ago and probably
25,000 or more years ago.</p>
<h3>Siberian Caucasoids</h3>
<p>Since 1950, Joseph Birdsell and
Carleton Coon have done something to clear a little
of the mist that has obscured the physical origins of
man in the New World. They agree, more or less, that
the first migrants were of Caucasoid stock from the
basin of the Amur River, in northeast Siberia.<a class="fn" id="fr_9_32" href="#fn_9_32">[32]</a></p>
<p>Birdsell, a close student of the Australian aborigines,
finds three strains in these peoples, one of which is
traceable to the &ldquo;white&rdquo; Ainus, of northern Japan, and
<span class="pb" id="Page_231">231</span>
finally to what he calls the Amurians of the aforementioned
river basin. In Australia their descendants are
rather short and stocky, with a &ldquo;rough-hewn Caucasoid
cast of features.&rdquo; Their craniums are long and low, with
large brow ridges&mdash;general traits of Pleistocene man as
well as some of our possibly early, and certainly problematical,
Americans. Coon supposes that natural selection
among the Amurians&mdash;trapped by the advance
of the fourth glaciation or one of its substages&mdash;produced
certain Mongoloid features that they later carried
into the New World. Birdsell sees among the
early migrants no Negritos, no full-sized Negroids, no
so-called Melanesians, no Mediterranean type of Caucasoids.
He suggests that a much-mixed strain of Caucasoid
Amurians and the newly evolved Mongoloid
race accounts for earliest man in the Americas. These
&ldquo;present the only discernible elements available at the
proper time and place to have contributed importantly
to the New World populations.... One may speculate
that if human populations reached the New
World in the third interglacial they could be expected
to be purely Caucasoid, that is Amurian, and to show
no Mongoloid characteristics.&rdquo; Birdsell suggests that
migrants coming after the last glaciation would carry
some Mongoloid features through hybridization.
Guardedly, Birdsell insists that, though this is a satisfying
and stimulating hypothesis, we have as yet no
means of judging accurately racial affiliations from a
single cranium or entire populations. He concludes&mdash;somewhat
sadly, we surmise&mdash;that methods utilized as
recently as 1949 (the date of his proposal) offer no
promise of unraveling in detail the enigma of the origins
of our earliest Americans.</p>

<br />DID THE INDIAN INVENT OR BORROW HIS CULTURE?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>American anthropologists usually deny that
Old World cultures have influenced to any great
extent the pre-Columbian development of the
American Indian. We have set up for Aboriginal
America a sort of</i> ex post facto <i>Monroe Doctrine
and are inclined to regard suggestions of alien influences
as acts of aggression. This is probably
a scientifically tenable position, although I am
afraid it has often been maintained in part by
an emotional bias&mdash;an &ldquo;America for Americans&rdquo;
feeling.</i>
<span class="lr">&mdash;<span class="small">EARNEST A. HOOTON</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Diffusion vs. Independent Invention</h3>
<p>We hope you
have not been skipping the choice thoughts that we
have placed at the beginning of chapters. Some of them
are merely amusing, but certain ones make an important
point. Such is the above remark from Hooton. It
calls our attention to an unscientific emotionalism
which often lies behind one of the dogmas of American
archaeology.</p>
<p>This dogma is called the autochthonous origin of Indian
cultures. It asserts that practically all the traits,
discoveries, and inventions which Columbus, Cortes,
and Pizarro found in the New World were homegrown
products&mdash;importations barred. The question at
issue between the friends and the opponents of this
dogma is commonly expressed as Independent Invention
versus Diffusion. But the phrasing is not quite accurate:
<span class="pb" id="Page_234">234</span>
it needs a little amplification. Anything invented
by man is in a sense an independent invention.
In the present case we are talking of an invention
made in one center, the New World, independent of a
similar invention in another center, the Old. We are
concerned, not with independent invention, but with
<i>parallel</i> independent invention. &ldquo;Diffusion&rdquo; is still
more inaccurate. Normally it means the gradual transfer
of some trait or technique from one people to another,
often through the intervention of a third or of a
third and a fourth people. In the present discussion it
is more a matter of a people&rsquo;s carrying the trait or the
technique to a new home. The question is not merely,
&ldquo;Did the Indian invent pottery?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did the American
Australoid invent the bull-roarer?&rdquo; It is rather,
&ldquo;Did he invent it in the New World or the Old?&rdquo; or
&ldquo;Did he invent it in the Old World and carry it to the
New?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Did he invent it in the New World while
another fellow invented it in the Old?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This problem of parallel independent invention versus
diffusion is important to any discussion of early
man, because it can also be phrased: &ldquo;Did he or did
he not bring traits from the Old World that may indicate
his racial ancestry?&rdquo;</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>Among the most curious resemblances between traits in
the New World and in the Old are those of Panpipes. Certain
pipes from the Solomon Islands have been found to
have the same scale and the same absolute pitch as specimens
from western Brazil. Double rows of pipes come
from the hinterland of Burma, from the Solomon Islands,
and from Panama and the Andean highlands, and in all
these areas the two rows are tuned in the same relation
to each other. The two sets may be lashed together, like
these from the Solomon Islands, left, and from Bolivia,
right, or they may be merely connected by a cord and
blown by two men or, alternately, by one. (Left, after von

Barbara Museum of Natural History.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Both the theory of diffusion and the theory of parallel,
independent invention arise from the same scientific
fact. This fact is that different primitive peoples
often make similar tools, build similar buildings, enjoy
similar institutions, live by similar customs, or believe
similar myths. And they do this although the tribes may
be widely separated from one another. To pin the
matter down to our own present concern, certain objects
found in the New World and dated before Columbus
are almost exactly like objects in the Old
World. For instance, a spear-thrower from western
Texas not only employs the same principle as one from
Australia, but has practically the same physical shape.
Curved throwing-sticks and bull-roarers come from
both these localities (see illustration, <a class="pgref" href="#Page_226">page 226</a>). Star-shaped
mace heads of Melanesian type turn up in
Peru. Looms that have the same eleven working parts
are found in areas of the New World as well as
the Old. Easter Island has polygonal stonework with
locked joints which matches a form of masonry in Andean
Peru, and a certain people of Easter Island
stretched their ear lobes in the same fashion as the Incas.
Panpipes of the Old World type appear in South
America, Panama, and California; some from western
Brazil are identical in tonal scale and absolute pitch
with some from the Solomon Islands (see illustration,
<a class="pgref" href="#Page_235">page 235</a>). In Hawaii and in Peru, as in Egypt and ancient
Japan, brothers married to sisters were of superior
status. The digging stick of certain Polynesians has
a step like that of the Indians of Peru. The quipu, or
knotted-string record, spread from Polynesia to Peru,
and the decimal system was found in both areas,
though farther north, in Middle America, men employed
the vigesimal system based on progression by
twenties. The Hindu game of pachisi resembles the
Mexican game of patolli. Lists have been published of
as many as fifty such similarities between Oceania and
the Americas.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_1" href="#fn_10_1">[1]</a></p>

<h3>Bastian&rsquo;s &ldquo;Psychic Unity&rdquo;</h3>
<p>Those who argue for independent
invention rest their case largely on a distortion
of the theory of &ldquo;psychic unity&rdquo; put forward by
Adolf Bastian in mid-Victorian days. From studies of
African and Asiatic cultures, Bastian developed the
thesis that &ldquo;psychic unity&rdquo; everywhere produced similar
&ldquo;elementary ideas.&rdquo; Thus early man in France and
early man in Asia might harden the point of a wooden
spear in a fire, or knock chips off a lump of flint to make
a sharper tool, or make a rope out of twisted vines. But
beyond &ldquo;elementary ideas,&rdquo; said Bastian, man would
develop different things in different places, depending
on different physical conditions; and finally, as he
reached a higher plane of mental and social development,
his ideas and his behavior would be influenced
by other men and other cultures with which he came
in contact. This was a sound thesis. Unfortunately,
however, Bastian&rsquo;s followers ignored the words &ldquo;elementary
ideas,&rdquo; as well as the last half of his theory,
and made &ldquo;psychic unity&rdquo; the provider of all good
things from pots to pyramids.</p>
<p>There have been opponents of independent invention,
of course. There were some in Bastian&rsquo;s day. They
pointed out&mdash;as Robert H. Lowie has done recently&mdash;that
the champion of the theory must prove that different
<span class="pb" id="Page_239">239</span>
peoples making similar things were subjected to
similar stimulants in both areas. Otherwise &ldquo;all the societies
of the world should share the features in question.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_2" href="#fn_10_2">[2]</a>
Lowie might have said that all cultures of man
should be alike today.</p>
<p>By and large, the diffusionists were in the minority.
The distorters of Bastian triumphed. They triumphed
even in the Old World, where distances were not always
very great, and where traffic between Africa and
Eurasia seemed not so very difficult. You can imagine,
therefore, what a happy hunting ground the independent
inventionists have made of the Americas. The
New World is remote indeed from the Old. You must
go back to the time of the glaciers to find a land-bridge
and up to the Arctic to bring the two worlds within
hailing distance of each other. Otherwise you must be
willing to accept thousands of miles of ocean voyaging.
The physical fact of the remoteness of the Americas
has stopped many a mental adventurer among the anthropologists.
He rereads with respect&mdash;perhaps too
much respect&mdash;these words of Spinden&rsquo;s: &ldquo;The fact that
no food plant is common to the two hemispheres is
enough to offset any number of petty puzzles in arts
and myths.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_3" href="#fn_10_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>If the physical fact of the Pacific Ocean had not been
enough to stifle talk of diffusion, the extravagant theories
of Sir Grafton Elliot Smith would have done the
job. Here was a diffusionist indeed! Echoed by W. J.
Perry, Smith found the beginnings of all culture of any
importance in Egypt, and from there he sent its traveling
salesmen abroad to sell it to Europe, Asia, and the
Americas. Pearls and pyramids, gold and dolmens, initiations
and totemism, sun worship and the marriage of
brother and sister, mummies&mdash;even if they were no
more than desiccated bodies wrapped in a bag&mdash;these
traits and many more all &ldquo;proved&rdquo; that the Children of
<span class="pb" id="Page_240">240</span>
the Sun had sold their cultural goods to lesser peoples.</p>
<p>There were other theorists as wild and whirling. Augustus
Le Plongeon brought the Maya from Atlantis to
found Egypt. Ignatius Donnelly reversed the procession
and dragged Greeks to Atlantis and then Mexico.
Lewis Spence transported Atlas across the Atlantic as
the Mexican god Quetzalcoatl. Leo Wiener, as Spinden
has put it, &ldquo;derives everything of importance in the
New World from the highly civilized coasts of Gambia
and Sierra Leone ... brightest Africa.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_4" href="#fn_10_4">[4]</a> And then
there was Churchward with his continent of Mu.</p>
<p>Smiths and Perry&rsquo;s uncritical use of evidence and
their distortion of fact&mdash;plus these fantasies of Africa
and Atlantis and Mu&mdash;put the friends of independent
invention even more firmly in the saddle than the single
and simple fact of the Pacific Ocean. The diffusion
of Smith <i>et al.</i> was a diffusion to end all diffusion.</p>
<p>Americanists&mdash;students of man in the New World&mdash;have
not yet escaped from the curse of the Children
of the Sun, and the terror of Atlantis and Mu. One of
the best, Baron Erland Nordenski&ouml;ld, a distinguished
Swedish scientist, gave a great deal of energy to the
cataloguing of the many evidences of analogies; and
yet he came to the conclusion that, by and large, Indian
culture was a product of independent invention
in the New World.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_5" href="#fn_10_5">[5]</a> He granted that the Indians may
have received from Oceania through random voyages
&ldquo;one or two cultivable plants and possibly a few more
culture elements&rdquo;&mdash;knowledge of how to make crude
clay vessels, for example.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_6" href="#fn_10_6">[6]</a> Hrdli&#269;ka, too, conceded a
small number of sea-borne visitors before Columbus:
&ldquo;It is ... probable that the western coast of America,
within the last 2,000 years, was on more than one occasion
reached by small parties of Polynesians, and
that the eastern coast was similarly reached by small
groups of whites, and that such parties may have locally
influenced the culture of the Americans.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_7" href="#fn_10_7">[7]</a> But
<span class="pb" id="Page_241">241</span>
Hrdli&#269;ka considered such voyaging of very little importance.</p>

<p>Only two anthropologists of any standing have favored
diffusion. The first of these, Earnest A. Hooton,
rejected &ldquo;the supposition that these various Asiatic invaders
brought with them to the New World nothing
but a repressed desire to indulge in independent invention,
that they came with culturally empty hands,
but brains stuffed full of patents to be filed only after
arrival.... I have no use at all for the anthropological
isolationists who are determined to maintain the incredible
<span class="pb" id="Page_242">242</span>
dogma that there was no diffusion of inventions
and ideas from the Old World to the New, but
only of naked human animals.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_8" href="#fn_10_8">[8]</a></p>
<h3>Complexity an Argument for Diffusion</h3>
<p>The chief modern American proponent of diffusion is Harold S.
Gladwin. What is his case? How does he come to his
conclusions? He begins, of course, by noting a large
number of random resemblances. Some are in simple
objects. Some are in complex ones. As he seeks a scientific
basis for his argument, he concentrates on the complex
things. Complexity seems to rule out coincidence.
If a tool has only one or two parts&mdash;like a curved throwing
stick or a hafted knife&mdash;it is not difficult to conceive
of two different men inventing it on opposite sides of
the world. A bow and arrow with three essential parts
presents a little more of a problem, but not too much,
for the three parts are dependent on one another. If
the bow has a back reinforced by sinew, if the arrow
has feathers and a foreshaft, and the foreshaft has a
flint arrowhead&mdash;making seven elements in all&mdash;then
one begins to wonder at the mathematical chances of
two men exactly duplicating the whole arrangement.
Then, consider the vertical loom with nine separate
elements, and eleven if it sports a shuttle and a reed
fork.</p>
<p>From citing such coincidences, Gladwin turns to the
second step of the diffusionist&rsquo;s argument. This has to
do not alone with one complex object, but with unrelated
things grouped around it&mdash;let us say a vertical
loom and bark cloth, painted tripod pottery, and metal
casting by the lost wax method. Now if all these disconnected
objects can be found in another locality
and in use by another people, the suggestion of diffusion
becomes far stronger than even in the case of a
single complex machine. As Gladwin puts it:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_243">243</div>
<p>If ... a man should report to the Chinese police
that some copper bells, a vertical loom, some tripod
trays, and a roll of bark cloth had been stolen from his
house, and if, after broadcasting the details, the American
police should find all these articles in the possession
of a man in America, where such things had hitherto
been unknown, would the authorities be satisfied with
the explanation that the possessor had independently
invented each item? I am inclined to think that, if I
should happen to be the attorney for the defense,
knowing that my client had recently come over from
Asia, a plea of insanity might carry more weight with
the jury than my client&rsquo;s explanation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He argues his point still more vividly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a Scotsman uses a split-bamboo trout rod, a waterproof
silkline, and a barbed hook, it is not necessarily
a case of diffusion if a man in Saskatchewan is found
to be fishing with a willow twig, a piece of string, and
a bent-pin, since each item is dependent upon the
others. But if in addition to their fishing tackle, the
Scotsman and the man in Saskatchewan are found to
possess a shot-gun, a flask, a brier-pipe and bagpipes,
then it would look like a case of diffusion since no one
item of the assemblage is dependent upon any other.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_9" href="#fn_10_9">[9]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Dispersion as Well as Diffusion</h3>
<p>The difficulty of this
second step in the diffusionist&rsquo;s argument lies in the
fact that it is hard indeed to find a complex of traits in
<i>one</i> American locality that resembles exactly a complex
of traits in a <i>single</i> Old World one. If the traits
are all together in Peru, some may come from one place
in the Old World and some from another. Or, if we
take a group of traits from a single Old World locale,
we find them spread out widely and separately in the
Americas. An excellent example of this may be drawn
from Oceania and South America. Dixon writes of the
diffusionists:</p>
<blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_244">244</div>
<p>When in South America, they say, you find not only
coca-chewing, plank canoes, and tie-dyeing, but also
terraced irrigation, Panpipes, and the blow gun&mdash;all
traits widespread in the western Pacific and southeastern
Asia&mdash;how can you deny that their occurrence is
due to diffusion, or believe for a moment that so many
similar and parallel inventions could take place? The
challenge is a formidable one. Is there anything that
can be said in reply?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dixon points out that these Oceanic traits are not
found <i>together</i> in the New World. The plank canoe is
confined to the Santa Barbara Islands and southern
Chile; tie-dyeing, to the arid coasts of northern Peru;
coca-chewing, originally to the Andean highlands and
the tropical forests along its eastern border; terraced irrigation,
to the Andes of Peru and Bolivia; the blow
gun, to the upper Amazon and Orinoco forests, the Antilles,
and the eastern United States; the Panpipe, to
the Amazon-Orinoco drainage and southward through
Bolivia to northern Chile and the Peruvian coast, and
to one or two isolated spots in Ecuador and Colombia.
&ldquo;With one exception the only area where the distribution
of any two of these traits is found to overlap lies
in the Andean highlands and the tropical forest area
to the eastward. Only tie-dyeing and the Panpipe are
found together on the coast.&rdquo; Further, the two traits we
find on the coast are separated in the Old World. Tie-dyeing
is found specifically in Indonesia &ldquo;and known in
Melanesia only in degenerate form in one small area,
whereas the Panpipe is primarily Melanesian and almost
unknown in Indonesia.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_10" href="#fn_10_10">[10]</a> He seems to be ignorant
of double Panpipes connected by a cord which
are found in the hinterland of Burma and also in Panama
and South America.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_11" href="#fn_10_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>No opponent of diffusionism is so blind as to deny
the importation of some culture traits by the migrants
from northern Asia. Kroeber concedes the fire drill, the
<span class="pb" id="Page_245">245</span>
spear-thrower, stone chipping, twisting of string, the
bow, the throwing harpoon, simple basketry and nets,
hunting complexes, cooking stones in vessels of wood,
of bark, or of skin, body painting and perhaps tattooing,
the domestication of dogs.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_12" href="#fn_10_12">[12]</a> But, except for these
and a few other examples, most anthropologists deny
that the American Indians, early or late, brought any
objects of their culture from the Old World. Alfred V.
Kidder has phrased very neatly their antagonism to
&ldquo;non-stop journeys by bag-and-baggage culture carriers.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_13" href="#fn_10_13">[13]</a>
This phrase is aimed at a weak chink in the
diffusionist&rsquo;s armor&mdash;the fact that Old World traits
found, say, in the Southwest, Middle America, or farther
south leave no trail across Alaska and down
through Canada and over the Great Plains.</p>
<p>In addition, the opponents of diffusion like to point
out that certain things in the Indian culture of the
northern part of the New World are like certain things
in the Indian culture of the southern part, while in between
lies a very large area&mdash;Middle America and
Peru&mdash;of entirely different culture traits. Here we find
none of the northern and southern things. Nordenski&ouml;ld
observes that, while some of the identical northern
and southern traits may be due to the stimulus of
similar cold climates, there are numerous traits that
have nothing to do with temperature and humidity.
He doubtless feels he is delivering the coup de gr&acirc;ce
when he writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a very characteristic fact that incomparably
greater similarity exists between civilizations as far
apart as those of the Calchaquis of Argentina, and the
Pueblos of North America, than between the culture
of any Indian tribe and that of any people in the whole
of Oceania.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_14" href="#fn_10_14">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>If such traits were diffused from one American area to
the other, they left no trace between. When we add
<span class="pb" id="Page_246">246</span>
this to the fact that from Alaska to Middle America
there are no traces of even the simplest beginnings of
the cultures of the central area, the advocate of independent
invention has a pretty good case. In answer,
the diffusionist has been tempted to argue that when
men are moving rather steadily across an area, they do
not leave evidence that is easy to find some millenniums
later. Only a hundred years have passed since
Brigham Young led his people from Independence,
Missouri, to Salt Lake City, and yet there is a singular
paucity of spinning wheels and first editions of <i>The
Book of Mormon</i> along their trail.</p>
<h3>The Trap of Time</h3>
<p>Gladwin has a better answer,
which is also an attack on a basic weakness of his opponents.
Through many years he has been pointing
out that friends of the inventive Indian have been
getting squeezed tighter and tighter in a trap of their
own independent invention. It is the trap of time.</p>
<p>When the Spaniards found the New World, they
found it full of inventions and discoveries. There were
cities of stone, painted temples, great pyramids. Metal
workers smelted ores, made alloys, and cast elaborate
ornaments of gold by a most intricate process. There
was a complex despotism in Mexico and as complex
and despotic a communism in Peru. The Maya had a
calendar more accurate than the one Columbus used.
They had devised a hieroglyphic writing and knew
how to make cement. The Indians of both continents
had developed an extensive agriculture, with potatoes
and fertilizers in Peru and corn and beans and tomatoes
all over the place.</p>
<p>As soon as the archaeologists decided that all this
had been invented in the New World with no help to
speak of from the Old, they had to recognize that it
would take quite a little time. At first this posed a difficulty,
for there was no very early evidence of man in
<span class="pb" id="Page_247">247</span>
Mexico. In 1917, however, came the discovery of skeletons
and pottery under a lava flow at Copilco near
Mexico City and of a primitive pyramid half buried
under the same flow at near-by Cuicuilco; and the archaeologists
promptly dated the eruption of the lava at
4000 <span class="small">B.C.</span></p>
<p>Then, unfortunately, new evidence narrowed the
trap of time once more. George C. Vaillant and his wife
dated other sites with the same kind of pottery as
Copilco considerably later than the birth of Christ. A
radiocarbon date based upon charcoal within the pottery
level below the Cuicuilco lava falls between these
guesses; it is 2422 &plusmn; 250 years.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_15" href="#fn_10_15">[15]</a> The Basket Makers
advanced from an estimated 2000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> to a tree-ring
date about <span class="small">A.D.</span> 217. And all this time nobody could
find any really primitive beginnings of pottery in Middle
America, and nothing that seemed earlier than the
birth of Christ. The trap of time was growing tighter
and tighter. A very elaborate civilization would have to
develop in 1,500 years, without any roots. Gladwin
pointed out this difficulty and urged the theory that
man came into the Americas not only as a paleolithic
primitive 15,000 or 25,000 years ago, but as a fairly
civilized and perfected neolithic close to the beginning
of the Christian era.</p>
<h3>Escape from the Trap</h3>
<p>The similarity between the
traits of the north and the south which Nordenski&ouml;ld
points out, and the fact that a different lot of traits were
dropped in between the others are grist to Gladwin&rsquo;s
diffusion mill. In 1937, when he wrote <i>Excavations at
Snaketown</i>, he was only beginning to see an answer.
By 1947, when <i>Men Out of Asia</i> appeared, he had a
fairly complete and certainly an ingenious explanation.</p>
<p>His first proposition is that the Mongoloids came late&mdash;very
late&mdash;and that they brought not much more than
the brawn and brains which someone else would later
<span class="pb" id="Page_248">248</span>
direct. His fifteenth chapter begins with the following
parody of a baseball score:</p>
<p class="center"><i>Score at the End of the Fourth Inning</i></p>
<dl class="undent pcap"><dt><span class="small">NORTH AMERICA</span> 4</dt>
<dd>Australoid, Folsom, Algonquin, Eskimo</dd>
<dt><span class="small">SOUTH AMERICA</span> 1</dt>
<dd>Australoid</dd>
<dt><i>No Discoveries<span class="hst"> No Inventions</span><span class="hst"> No Mongoloids</span></i></dt></dl>
<p>By 300 <span class="small">B.C.</span>&mdash;two hundred years after the Eskimo&mdash;Gladwin
is willing to add 1 run to the North American
score and make that run Mongoloid. But he does not
believe that the Mongoloids reached South America in
any numbers, or contributed anything but labor to the
culture which Columbus found. They did not make
black-on-white pottery in the Pueblo country or red-on-buff
pottery and irrigation canals in southern Arizona,
create incised pottery, pyramids, carved jade, or
a calendar system and hieroglyphs in Middle America,
pound bark cloth in Central America, or produce stone
fortresses and superb weaving and portrait jugs in
Peru. Left to their own devices, the Mongoloids would
have accomplished no more in the New World than
they had in the Old before the Huns made things unpleasant
for them in northern China. Gladwin believes
that the people who created the culture of Middle
America and Peru came overseas, spreading north and
south from the isthmus of Panama. The suggested invasion
by water explains the odd fact that many of the
traits of northern North America are like some of those
of southern South America, and not at all like most of
the traits of the area between. Some of these northern
and southern traits, says Gladwin, are the property of
the Australoids who came far back; others in North
America find analogies in China and northern Asia.
His overseas peoples thrust themselves and their culture
into the central part of the New World, changing
<span class="pb" id="Page_249">249</span>
or obliterating the Australoid traits that they found
there, and isolating those that lay to the north and
south. He believes that these people brought with
them certain objects and customs from the islands in
the Pacific, from southeastern Asia, and from China
and points west. Among them is the habit of squeezing
a baby&rsquo;s head between boards to give it an elegant
elongation; this head deformation is not practiced in
northern Asia, from which the Indians are presumed to
have come.</p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to point out that Gladwin&rsquo;s
hypothesis disposes of the question: &ldquo;Why are there no
traces of Middle American and Peruvian traits on the
trail down from Alaska?&rdquo; But we might ask: &ldquo;Why are
there not more of them in the Pacific islands?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gladwin has not worked out his maritime invasions
too thoroughly; but he sees the Melanesians&mdash;who, he
believed, reached Easter Island&mdash;continuing on to Central
America and becoming the Caribs and spreading
into South America and the West Indies. He sees the
Polynesians taking much the same route and turning
into the Arawaks.</p>
<p>What started these South Sea islanders off on their
career of civilizing the central part of the Americas?
Where did they get some of the traits and some of the
physical features that Melanesians and Polynesians do
not now possess, as well as their inventive brains? Here
Gladwin has a startling and fabulous theory to put forward.
Here is where Alexander the Great and his sailors
and ships come in.</p>
<h3>Dead Alexander Invades America</h3>

Stirling, 1940; the last, after Covarrubias, 1946.)</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_251">251</div>
<p>Before Alexander
died in 323 <span class="small">B.C.</span> he brought 5,000 Levantine and Greek
shipwrights and sailors to the Persian Gulf and built
a navy of 800 vessels. We hear a good deal about what
his army did after his death, of the quarrels of generals
and the dissipation of their forces&mdash;but not a word
about the 5,000 nautical men or their fleet. As Gladwin
points out, it is hard to imagine that sailors with sound
vessels under them would take shore leave and walk
home to Greece. If they sailed away from the Persian
Gulf, which way would they have gone? They would
hardly have sailed southwestward along the Arabian
coast; for Alexander died at a season when the winds
would have been against them, and the coast is lacking
in fresh water and harbors at any time. A southeastward
voyage would have been another matter. The
wind would have been behind them, and they had already
found the coast attractive in that direction.</p>
<p>With this much to go upon, Gladwin sends the fleet
of the dead Alexander down the coast of India, past
the Spice Islands, and out through Melanesia, Micronesia,
and Polynesia. On the way the fleet picks up
men and women of various races, and stimulates the
whole South Seas into a navigating era. The end result
is another discovery of America. It is a discovery
by a varied and talented people. Along with the Melanesian-Carib
and Polynesian-Arawak, the fleet of
Gladwin and Alexander finally brings to our western
shores those bearded white men with civilizing propensities
who are found in the legends of the Toltec
and Maya and the peoples of Colombia and Peru. They
it is who teach the Mongoloids how to build stone
edifices, work metals, weave textiles, and make fine
pots. Gladwin documents all this assiduously and even
goes to his opponents for evidence.</p>
<p>He bolsters his argument with the &ldquo;Q Complex&rdquo;&mdash;that
list of traits in the cultures of Middle America and
the southeastern portion of the United States which
Vaillant and Lothrop compiled as being very old indeed
and unaccounted for in present theory. <i>Men Out
of Asia</i> suggests that the Levantine voyagers brought
these things or shaped them after they landed.</p>
<p>He uses with the greatest relish the mass of material
<span class="pb" id="Page_252">252</span>
on Oceanic traits in the Americas that Nordenski&ouml;ld
drew together in &ldquo;Origin of the Indian Civilizations in
South America.&rdquo; Of the forty-nine elements of culture
which the Swede found common to both regions, Gladwin
points out that more occur in Colombia and Panama
than in any other New World area&mdash;thirty-eight
in all&mdash;and that Colombia and Panama surround the
spot where ships would have landed if they had followed
the Equatorial Counter Current to the Gulf of
Darien. From this region as a center the Melanesian
and Polynesian traits gradually thin out to the north,
the south, and the east.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig81">
<img src="images/i064.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="491" />
<p class="pcapc"><i>The Equatorial Counter Current, which flows just north
of the equator, varies in width from 150 to 500 miles. The
winds in this area are light and blow from south of east
over its southern area and north of east over its northern
area.</i></p>
</div>
<p>Against Gladwin&rsquo;s argument must be set, however,
the evidence that Gonzalo Aguirre Beltr&aacute;n has recently
developed showing that, among the slaves sent to
<span class="pb" id="Page_253">253</span>
Mexico from Manila during the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries, there were many from New Guinea
and other Pacific islands.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_16" href="#fn_10_16">[16]</a> Was there a similar trade
with Colombia, where Oceanic traits are slightly more
plentiful than in Mexico and Central America, and
with Amazonia, where they are almost as plentiful? It
is vitally important, however, to remember that Melanesian
slaves cannot possibly be credited with the importation
of objects that have been found in pre-Columbian
burials&mdash;certain Panpipes and mace heads,
for example.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other objections, of course, to
Gladwin&rsquo;s theory, even though it seems to explain
much that has been a mystery; but there are also defenses
that he has not made. If the islands of the Pacific
are not too well provided with pottery, pyramids, cement,
metallurgy, and textiles, he might have pointed
out that they were imperfectly supplied with the
proper raw materials. If the white voyagers left their
triremes behind in favor of double canoes, and if they
did not build Greek temples in the New World, he
might have suggested that some generations of sojourn
in the South Seas led them to forget a few things. Indeed,
it is surprising that these sailors remembered so
much of weaving, metal working, and pottery (minus
the potter&rsquo;s wheel). It is equally surprising and just a
little disquieting that the white gods, almost as soon as
they landed, invented a complex and unique calendar
and a hieroglyphic system like nothing they were familiar
with. (Perhaps they could not agree on which of
the many Old World varieties to use and had to devise
something new.)</p>
<p>Before pouncing too heavily on Gladwin and his
Alexandrians, it may be well to reread some sentences
in his Introduction:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We are going to offer an explanation that will be a
<span class="pb" id="Page_254">254</span>
radical departure from those in current circulation, and
I shall be the first to admit that this tale will need a
great deal of patching and strengthening before it will
carry much weight. This may seem a strange way to
launch a new theory, but I am more concerned in
opening up new channels of inquiry than in trying to
provide pat answers to all the questions that are plaguing
us.... I do not know of anyone who has yet
been rash enough to try to connect the origins of
American civilizations with definite causes, at definite
dates, in the progress of Old World history, and it is
for this reason that I have said this tale will need support
and will undoubtedly need to be changed. This,
however, is the way that every theory should be
treated, and no harm will be done if when a new idea
is launched it is regarded with due reserve, but also
without prejudice.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_17" href="#fn_10_17">[17]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our <a href="#c13">next chapter</a> will return to rather formidable
arguments for inventiveness in the American Indian;
but first we should perhaps point out that Gladwin is
not an Elliot Smith riding the hobby of diffusion to the
end. He admits independent invention in many important
fields. Pottery was invented, he believes, at
least twice in the Old World. He concedes a number
of origins for agriculture in the New. But he believes
that the really inventive men of the New World&mdash;the
men who developed corn, and devised the Maya
calendar&mdash;were the men who brought brains as well as
cultural equipment in the ships of Alexander, and put
those brains to work devising more cultural equipment.
(He ignores the fact that corn was developed more
than a thousand years before Alexander was born.)
Gladwin simply does not consider that early man and
his successors before the birth of Christ were smart
enough to produce much more than exceptionally good
spear points and rather inferior milling stones. He does
not believe that the Australoids or the Folsom men or
the Algonquins or the Mongoloids who came over just
<span class="pb" id="Page_255">255</span>
before our era&mdash;let alone the Uto-Aztecans or the Athabascans
a little later&mdash;were capable of inventing much
in the way of neolithic civilization. He points out that
the Indian&mdash;bereft, presumably, of the brains and blood
of the men of Alexander&rsquo;s fleet&mdash;has not done much inventing
in the past four centuries. An opponent might
remark that many an inventive, creative people has
lapsed from grace&mdash;the Egyptians and the Greeks, for
instance. The Polynesians and the Melanesians have
not done much more inventing than the Indians since
the days when the Alexandrians turned them into pre-Columbian
pioneers of America culture.</p>
<h3>Independent Inventions Neither Parallel Nor Diffused</h3>
<p>It will be some years before the debate of diffusion
versus independent invention comes anywhere near
settlement. Much of Gladwin&rsquo;s evidence for diffusion
is striking and not to be laughed aside&mdash;particularly the
group of Australian traits in our Southwest, and the
Polynesian and Melanesian traits in the area around
the Gulf of Darien. His injection of Old World voyagers
between the northern and southern areas of the
New World explains certain puzzling matters; but the
theory presents puzzles of its own. Many culture traits
of Middle America and Peru are not found in Oceania:
the use of cement in masonry and the vigesimal system
of numeration in Middle America; the amazingly
intricate Maya calendar and hieroglyphics with the
first invention of zero; baked brick in two Mexican
sites; bronze in Peru; the hammock; the whistling jar;
the manioc press. Some of these New World traits
must have been invented here, but we are asked to
believe that the others were forgotten in Oceania and
remembered in the Americas. One argument for trans-Pacific
diffusion is clear and cogent, however. It is hard
to believe that the men who voyaged as far as the
Marquesas and Easter Island stopped there, and so
<span class="pb" id="Page_256">256</span>
missed our long coast line. Certainly the sweet potato
made the ocean crossing in the reverse direction, but
was it before Columbus?<a class="fn" id="fr_10_18" href="#fn_10_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>Other things went with the sweet potato, according
to the great chemist Gilbert N. Lewis. Without believing
that man originated in South America, he thinks
that man first reached the neolithic level in the area
east of the Peruvian Andes while his fellow man in the
rest of the world was wandering in paleolithic darkness.
In the Andean highlands, man developed architecture,
numeration, metallurgy, weaving, sculpture,
and so forth. He spread these things to Middle America
6,000 or 8,000 years ago, and then carried them across
the Pacific to the Old World.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_19" href="#fn_10_19">[19]</a> As a whole, Lewis&rsquo;s
theory may be unacceptable; but his arguments for
diffusion and against independent invention are persuasive.</p>
<p>In 1947 six Scandinavians demonstrated the possibility
of an east-west crossing by sailing and drifting
4,300 miles in 101 days on a primitive raft of balsa logs
from Peru to an atoll not many days from Tahiti.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_20" href="#fn_10_20">[20]</a></p>
<p>The position of the American partisans of independent
invention is a curious one. It is both weak and
strong. Man is inventive&mdash;even primitive man. But his
inventions often have a unique quality: they are not
always duplicated, or they are not duplicated at the
same level of cultural development. Consider the cave
paintings and the sculpture of the Aurignacians, Solutreans,
and Magdalenians in the late Paleolithic. It is
an art of remarkable perfection that utterly disappeared,
and was not equaled again for thousands upon
thousands of years. At Bonampak, in southern Mexico,
a Maya painter used consummate perspective and
foreshortening long before they appeared in Asia.
Then there are the unique Folsom point, the perfection
of the Solutrean and Eden points, the Maya calendar
and hieroglyphs, the mosaic walls of Mitla in Mexico,
<span class="pb" id="Page_257">257</span>
Egyptian architecture and sculpture as well as writing,
the beautifully expressive masks of the African Negro,
the Melanesian, and the Eskimo. These were independent
inventions, but they were unique ones. They
were not independent, <i>parallel</i> inventions. And they
were not diffused.</p>
<p>As for early man in the New World, we may believe
if we wish that the shape of the Sandia point was diffused
from the Solutreans of Europe. We may deny
the independent invention in our Southwest of spear-throwers,
bull-roarers, bunt points, and curved throwing sticks
that look more as if they had been brought
from Australia. The Eden point may have come from
Siberia, or Siberia may have got it from North America.
The Folsom point, however, looks definitely like an independent
invention, for it is found nowhere else in
the world. This argues that the people who ultimately
succeeded in making it must have been in the New
World for many, many generations before one of them
lashed a Folsom point to a spear and thrust it into a
bison. Where are the flints they shaped before the
Sandia, Clovis, and Folsom? Can they have evolved
the craft of flint knapping here in the New World?
When we know this, we shall probably know whether
they came before or after the last glaciers.</p>
<h3>What Diffusion of Plants and Art?</h3>
<p>Meantime it is interesting
to observe that the log-jam of the independent
inventionists is weakening a bit. When the International
Congress of Americanists met in New York
in 1949, the hitherto conservative and autochthonous
American Museum of Natural History presented for
the instruction and delectation of the Congress a rather
elaborate exhibition of parallelisms between the cultural
traits of the Old World and the New. A follow-up
to this noteworthy gathering was a symposium of many
of the same anthropologists at a meeting, two years
<span class="pb" id="Page_258">258</span>
later, of the American Association for the Advancement
of Science. The theme was &ldquo;Prehistoric and
Historic Asia: Transpacific Contacts with the New
World.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_10_21" href="#fn_10_21">[21]</a> The question of contacts was not squelched,
but there was no substantial progress in finding answers.
The symposium focused the problem on two
tests of possible diffusion. These concerned domesticated
plants and formal art.</p>
<p>The strongest cases that can be made for the diffusion
of any plant concern the <i>Lagenaria</i> gourd, cotton,
the sweet potato, and the coconut. None of these
ranks as a staple of subsistence, and two of them are
not even food plants. Thus Old World and New World
crops are mutually exclusive. The four plants that we
have mentioned may have had world-wide distribution
before man reached the New World; they may
have followed the first contacts of white men with the
Americas; there is only a remote possibility that they
crossed the ocean through natural agencies.</p>
<p>In formal art&mdash;or perhaps we should say religious art&mdash;there
are some tantalizing prospects for rather recent
Asia-America diffusion. Gordon Ekholm, of the American
Museum of Natural History, has listed a number
of these. He suggests that the time of contact would
have been about 700 <span class="small">A.D.</span> This, you will note, is much
too late to do much in shaping American civilization.
At the most, it would have furnished no more than a
bit of Asiatic frosting upon the cake of American civilization.
Drawing upon elements of art from India,
southeast Asia, and Indonesia, Ekholm points to similarities
in Maya, Mexican, or other native American
art, where parallels seem to exist in such things as a
trefoil arch, a sacred tree or cross, tiger thrones, conch-shell-and-plant,
Atlantean figures, monster doorways,
serpent columns and balustrades, and others.<a class="fn" id="fr_10_22" href="#fn_10_22">[22]</a> The
comparisons are provocative, to say the least. In the
Maya area, where most of the suspected influence of
<span class="pb" id="Page_259">259</span>
Asia occurs, many forms of art steadily deteriorated
during the period when, theoretically, Asiatic stimulation
would have been most pronounced.</p>
<p>Can we logically assume that the Maya would borrow
a lotus motif or a serpent column from southeast
Asia, but not the dome or true arch? Is it likely that
sailors from Asia or Oceania succeeded in introducing
useful plants but not sails or boats that could tack
against the wind? If transoceanic diffusion is to be considered
seriously, should there be no evidence for even
a few practical seagoing inventions shared between
the Old World and the New? Surely this would be
more acceptable to the Americanists than forcing the
assumption of transoceanic diffusion upon the presence
of cultivated plants of secondary importance, or theological
concepts expressed so vaguely as to be subject
to alternative interpretations.</p>

<br />THE INDIAN IN AGRICULTURE</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Corn, which is the staff of life.</i>
<span class="lr">&mdash;<span class="small">EDWARD WINSLOW</span>, <i>Good Newes from New England</i>, (1624)</span></p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Inventions&mdash;Some New, Some Old</h3>
<p>Let us forget, for
the moment, white conquerors like Alexander and
white gods like Quetzalcoatl. Let us suppose that the
Indian actually invented his own culture.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we throw diffusion out of
the window; for the Indian may have invented things
in the Old World and brought them to the New&mdash;which
is one kind of diffusion. On the other hand, he may
have invented in the Americas the same things that
other peoples were inventing&mdash;before or after him&mdash;in
Eurasia. That, of course, is independent invention.</p>
<p>There is a third possibility: that the Indian invented
things in the New World which none of the peoples
of the Old World ever invented. If he could do this,
then it is obvious that he could invent some things
which other people had also invented. The Indians
ability to invent uniquely is a far stronger argument
for independent invention than the theory of &ldquo;psychic
unity.&rdquo; It is also an argument for early man, if the
things invented can be dated far back in time.</p>
<p>Nordenski&ouml;ld and others list a number of inventions
that are unique to the New World.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_1" href="#fn_11_1">[1]</a> Among them are
the hammock; the tube of diagonally woven fibers
<span class="pb" id="Page_262">262</span>
which enabled the lowland Indians of South America
to squeeze the poison from the manioc and produce
wholesome tapioca; the ventilating and cooling system
of the kivas (the subterranean religious chambers of
the pueblos); the Peruvian whistling jar; the cigar,
cigarette, tobacco pipe, cigar holder; the quipu (a set
of knotted strings for counting); the enema syringe;
the hollow rubber ball; elastic rings; the toboggan;
the Maya calendar and hieroglyphs; and possibly the
snowshoe. If the list is not very impressive, consider
how few unique inventions the Old World could
muster in the same kind of stone age.</p>
<p>The significance of the list is reinforced by our
knowledge of certain parallel inventions which the Indian
is presumed to have made without aid from
the Old World. One is metallurgy. In South America,
he discovered rather late how to smelt metals and
make bronze. This lateness, according to Nordenski&ouml;ld,
proves independent invention. If migrants brought
over the knowledge of metallurgy, they left no trace
of it along their journey, either in North America or
in the South Seas; and there is no Indian folklore telling
of how their forefathers or their gods brought
bronze to the New World. Nordenski&ouml;ld makes the
further point that, having invented the casting of
metal, the Indians must also have invented the forms
in which they cast it&mdash;the socketed ax, for example, the
bell, and the pincers. On the basis of these inventions
in metallurgy, and other inventions, Nordenski&ouml;ld
writes, &ldquo;It is surely a matter of logical reasoning to
suppose that independent inventions may have been
made by them in the realms of architecture, weaving,
ceramics, etc.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_2" href="#fn_11_2">[2]</a> This would be a very much better
argument, of course, if bronze had never been invented
in the Old World. Then no boatload of Alexandrians
could ever refute it.</p>
<p>Nordenski&ouml;ld might have added agriculture to his
<span class="pb" id="Page_263">263</span>
list of unique Indian inventions&mdash;or rather the products
of agriculture. The Indian discovered and cultivated
plants unknown to the Old World. He developed special
varieties suited to special conditions of soil and
climate. In a sense he even invented one very important
plant, for botanists have been unable to find any
wild ancestor of Indian corn.</p>

<h3><i>American Plants and Their Cultivation</i></h3>
<p>The list of
important plants that made up the Indian&rsquo;s agriculture
<span class="pb" id="Page_264">264</span>
is impressive. It is also unique, for it contains few Old
World species. In the northeastern United States there
were a few wild fruits and berries&mdash;grapes and blackberries,
for example&mdash;that are common to the north
temperate zones of both hemispheres. In Middle
America were two plants which are found in Asia and
the South Sea Islands&mdash;the bottle gourd and the coconut
palm&mdash;and cotton of a different species from that
of Eurasia and Africa. Otherwise, &ldquo;of cultivable
plants,&rdquo; says Nordenski&ouml;ld, &ldquo;the ancient American
higher civilizations possessed none in common with
the Old World.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_3" href="#fn_11_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>There are two very curious facts about primitive husbandry
in the New World. The Americas provided the
Indian with few animals that could be domesticated,
and no draft animals at all. Because he had no ox and
no horse, he could not use a plow, and did not invent
one. Fortunately, on the other hand, the Americas had
no plants that required plow cultivation and field sowing.
Wild rice grew in lakes. The rest of the plants responded
to hoe culture. Or, rather, since the Indian
used the hoe only in limited areas&mdash;and probably quite
late, at that&mdash;the seeds could be placed in the ground
with a planting stick, and after a little hand cultivation
the shade of the abundant leaves would take care of
the weeds. Beans, corn, manioc, and potatoes&mdash;the
four major crops&mdash;were ideally suited to the only means
the Indian possessed for planting and cultivating.</p>
<p>This difference between agriculture in the Mediterranean
area and the New World is quite as great as
the difference between the pastoral activities of the
Fertile Crescent and the scanty domestication of animals
in the Americas. Here there is no solace for the
diffusionist. As Lowie has said, &ldquo;There is more resemblance
between the Ionic capital and a Papuan headrest
than between the sowing of cereals and the planting
of a banana shoot.&rdquo; (If he had been thinking
<span class="pb" id="Page_265">265</span>
specifically of our present problem, he would have substituted
corn kernel or potato eye for banana shoot.)
&ldquo;Bee-keeping is not the same as training elephants or
herding horses; and sowing seeds is not equivalent to
planting a side-shoot or a tuber, let alone ridding a
tuber [manioc] of its prussic acid.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_4" href="#fn_11_4">[4]</a></p>
<h3>When and Where Did Our Agriculture Begin?</h3>
<p>There are two questions to be asked about agriculture
in the New World: Where did it originate and with
what plants? Did it have a multiple origin&mdash;which
would entail a sort of independent invention? These
questions have a bearing on how much time man spent
in the inventing and perfecting of agriculture, and
therefore on how long he had been thoroughly settled
in the Americas when the Spaniards came.</p>
<p>Not so many years ago, Indian corn, or maize, was
carelessly considered the first plant cultivated in the
Americas&mdash;probably because it was the most spectacular&mdash;and
was supposed to have originated in the highlands
of Mexico or Guatemala. Now we know that
pumpkins preceded corn, and so, in all probability, did
most of the commoner food plants. Beans and melons,
with their free-running vines and prominent flowers
and seed pods, would seem most likely to have first
attracted man&mdash;or, perhaps, woman&mdash;and led him to
assist the processes of nature.</p>
<p>When corn was king, semiarid farm lands were supposed
to be the place of its origin. Spinden saw &ldquo;irrigation
as an invention which accounts for the very
origin of agriculture itself.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_5" href="#fn_11_5">[5]</a> Semiarid land, however,
is notoriously hard to clear; though its plants are few,
they have deep, tenacious roots. River flood plains of
the Sonoran desert in Mexico&mdash;ideal by Spinden&rsquo;s
standard&mdash;yield no evidence of long or extensive occupation,
according to Carl Sauer. Where irrigation was
used in our Southwest, dates are not early. The evidence
<span class="pb" id="Page_266">266</span>
of the plants themselves, he writes, &ldquo;overwhelmingly
points not to desert or steppe but to several
humid climates for their origin.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_6" href="#fn_11_6">[6]</a></p>
<p>There has never been much enthusiasm for the
humid tropic lowlands as the seedbed of agriculture.
Of late years the students of botany have turned to
the temperate forest area and particularly to the mountain
valley as the seat of agriculture. This has been
championed by N. I. Vavilov and a group of Russian
scientists, sent to the Americas in the 1920&rsquo;s, who made
a most elaborate study of our native cultivated plants.
Much of their evidence is too technical for presentation
here, but their conclusions have seemed convincing
to many students.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_7" href="#fn_11_7">[7]</a> A mountain valley provides a
wider range of temperature and rainfall and a greater
variety of native plants. Its forest trees, before they are
cleared by girdling and burning, store up a rich humus
under their shade. Costa Rica and El Salvador&mdash;full of
isolated mountain valleys&mdash;contain, according to Henry
J. Bruman, as many species of plants as the United
States, in spite of the fact that the United States is a
hundred times the size of the two countries together.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_8" href="#fn_11_8">[8]</a>
The Russians believe that agriculture took early shape
in certain mountain valley areas, including southern
Mexico, Central America, Colombia, highland Peru,
western Bolivia, and southern Chile. Though they do
not commit themselves as to whether agriculture originated
in one place and spread later to others, &ldquo;their
evidence,&rdquo; Sauer thinks, &ldquo;may be interpreted in favor
of multiple independent beginnings.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_9" href="#fn_11_9">[9]</a> But Bruman,
writing of their work, points out that the &ldquo;enormous
spread of maize and beans, of cotton and tobacco, for
example, shows that there is &lsquo;something of the undivided
whole&rsquo; in the great cultures of the New World,
as Vavilov well expresses it.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_10" href="#fn_11_10">[10]</a> Richard S. MacNeish,
an archaeologist who spent at least a dozen years on
the matter, declared in 1960, &ldquo;There were multiple
<span class="pb" id="Page_267">267</span>
origins of New World domesticated plants, at different
times.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_11" href="#fn_11_11">[11]</a></p>
<p>It is amusing to note that the diffusionists and the
partisans of independent invention change places on
the subject of corn. Spinden diffuses all corn from
Middle America. Gladwin plumps for various areas
of independent invention, including the Mississippi
Valley.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_12" href="#fn_11_12">[12]</a></p>
<h3>The Indian&rsquo;s Accomplishment in Agriculture</h3>
<p>There
can be no argument over the remarkable nature of
certain things that the Indian farmer accomplished.
Through long cultivation he produced the seedless
pineapple. When he found that one form of manioc
was poisonous, he took thought and devised a press for
squeezing out the deadly cyanide while retaining the
starch. Bruman calls this &ldquo;one of the outstanding accomplishments
of the American Indian.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_13" href="#fn_11_13">[13]</a> He says
further:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The original process of plant selection seems to have
been carried on more intensively in the Americas than
elsewhere. The major crop plants were farther removed
from their wild ancestors than those of any
other part of the earth at the time of the discovery.
Mention need only be made of corn, which is so distinct
as to require classification in a unique genus, and
of the potato, which resulted probably from the crossing
of many and various Solanaceae.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[The Solanaceae include nightshade, jimson weed, tobacco, and others.] It
is ironic that, as O. F. Cook has observed, the white potatoes grown each year are
worth more than all the gold that the Spaniards took
from the Incas.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_14" href="#fn_11_14">[14]</a> This is probably still truer of Indian
corn.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>From Fuch&rsquo;s</i> De Historia Stirpium, <i>published in 1542,

years earlier, Oviedo printed a drawing of an ear of corn.

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_269">269</div>
<p>On November 5, 1492, two Spaniards whom Columbus
had sent into the interior of Cuba told him of &ldquo;a
sort of grain they call maiz which was well tasted,
bak&rsquo;d, dry&rsquo;d, and made into flour.&rdquo; Thus came the first
news of what P. C. Mangelsdorf and R. G. Reeves,
authorities on corn, call &ldquo;a cereal treasure of immensely
greater value than the spices which Columbus
traveled so far to seek.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_15" href="#fn_11_15">[15]</a></p>
<p>The fact that corn is today the second most important
food crop of the world is due to its unique adaptability.
In 1492 at least seven hundred different varieties
of this grain were growing in widely varied areas of
half the western hemisphere. Today corn is grown on
all the continents, and its habitats range from 58&deg; north
latitude in Canada and Russia to 40&deg; south of the equator
in Argentina.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fields of maize are growing below sea level in the
Caspian plain and at altitudes of more than 12,000
feet in the Peruvian Andes. Corn is cultivated in regions
of less than ten inches of annual rainfall in the
semi-arid plains of Russia, and in regions with more
than 200 inches of rain in the tropics of Hindustan. It
thrives almost equally well in the short summers of
Canada and the perpetual summer of tropical Colombia.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_16" href="#fn_11_16">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the Gasp&eacute; Peninsula in the province of Quebec and
for the Pyrenees Mountains there is a variety that
matures in two months; for Colombia there is one that
requires ten or eleven months. The height ranges from
two feet to twenty; the leaves vary from eight to forty-eight;
the number of stalks by a single seed, from one
to twelve; the ears from three inches to three feet. Authorities
used to list from five to eight basically different
types of corn; the five are sweet, flour, dent, flint,
and pop. &ldquo;The Russians,&rdquo; write P. C. Mangelsdorf and
R. G. Reeves, &ldquo;have already collected more than 8,000
varieties.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_17" href="#fn_11_17">[17]</a></p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_272">272</div>
<p>All the chief types of corn known today were developed
by the Indians to suit the wide variety of lands
and climates in which they lived. The feat seems all
the more remarkable because botanists tell us that all
these varieties had to be developed by keen observation
and hard work from a single parent species&mdash;<i>Zea
mays L.</i>&mdash;and modern man has never found corn in a
wild form. This amazingly varied plant, which cannot
properly seed itself and will die without man&rsquo;s intervention,
was evolved from a plant that is now apparently
extinct.</p>
<p>In spite of the old saw about the staff of life, a starchy
grain is not the ideal food; but corn, says Sauer, is the
most useful of all American starches because in addition
to its ease of storage &ldquo;it contains also fat and
protein and is a more nearly complete food than the
others.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_18" href="#fn_11_18">[18]</a></p>
<h3>How Old Is Corn?</h3>
<p>Obviously it must have taken
many long years for the Indian to develop corn from
its unknown ancestor into its many and widespread varieties.
One botanical authority, G. N. Collins, thinks
20,000 years would not be enough&mdash;if a gross mutation,
or sudden genetic change, were ruled out.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_19" href="#fn_11_19">[19]</a> Other
botanists do not accept such a figure. The development
of corn may have taken a good many centuries or, more
likely, a few millenniums. Behind corn must lie more
centuries or more millenniums during which the first
agriculturists of the New World discovered how to
grow other plants, because whether corn originated in
Middle America, Colombia, or Paraguay&mdash;independent
inventionists argue for each locality&mdash;or in all three
with the Mississippi Valley thrown in, there can be no
question that it came later than most of the other cultivated
plants. This adds still more years to the story of
the civilizing of man in the Americas. Bruman writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Whether this high specialization of cultivated plant
life can be used as an indication of greater age on the
<span class="pb" id="Page_273">273</span>
part of American agriculture in comparison to that of
the Old World is a difficult point. In the writer&rsquo;s opinion
it may indicate merely a greater agricultural
awareness on the part of the Indian, a cultural trait
no doubt strongly furthered by the relative unimportance
of domesticated animals.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_20" href="#fn_11_20">[20]</a></p>

found in Bat Cave, New Mexico. (After Mangelsdorf and

</div>
<p>Sylvanus G. Morley believed that the Maya cultivated
corn at a time close to 1000 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_11_21" href="#fn_11_21">[21]</a> which was,
of course, no more than a guess. MacNeish states that
the most ancient corn of the Maya area, found in the
gulf state of Tamaulipas, dates from about 5,000 years
ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_22" href="#fn_11_22">[22]</a> We may presume that the Maya were cultivating
it some centuries earlier. Antevs gives a date of
&ldquo;not later than 2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span>&rdquo; for a layer of refuse in Bat
Cave, New Mexico, in which Herbert W. Dick found
the cobs and kernels of a primitive form of maize that
is both a pod corn and a pop corn. These cobs&mdash;now
dated by radiocarbon at about 5,600 years ago<a class="fn" id="fr_11_23" href="#fn_11_23">[23]</a>&mdash;range
from 2&#8540; inches to 3&frac34; inches in length. Though
probably not specimens of the long-sought wild corn,
they are not far removed in characteristics.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_24" href="#fn_11_24">[24]</a> In coastal
Peru&mdash;where corn could not have started&mdash;Julio C. Tello
<span class="pb" id="Page_274">274</span>
found kernels in the ruins of Paracas, along with
manioc roots, sweet potatoes, and beans. There is a
radiocarbon date of about 2,250 years ago for cotton
cloth from a mummy found at Paracas.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_25" href="#fn_11_25">[25]</a> In a preceramic
culture about 5,000 years old,<a class="fn" id="fr_11_26" href="#fn_11_26">[26]</a> Duncan Strong
and Junius Bird found no corn, but evidence that these
early agriculturists had raised cotton, squash, and
other plants.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_27" href="#fn_11_27">[27]</a></p>
<p>It seems unlikely that any form of agriculture could
have been developed from native plants in coastal
Peru, for it is as arid a spot as can be found anywhere
in our hemisphere. Only an elaborate system of irrigation
canals enabled this area to grow extensively corn,
beans, and other plants. In the highly developed civilization
of the coast&mdash;so close to the guano islands&mdash;the
Indians started the use of fertilizers, which was to be a
feature of Peruvian agriculture. The development of irrigation
and fertilizer, plus city architecture and the
finest pottery in the Americas, spells many years of
slowly growing civilization in coastal Peru, and behind
these beginnings must have lain centuries upon centuries
of earlier agricultural discoveries and improvements
in the hinterlands. The only alternative is to accept
the diffusion of a full-blown culture across the
Pacific.</p>
<p>There are those who believe that corn did in fact
come from Asia to the Americas. Sauer points out that
Asia has more kinds of the wild grasses, Gramineae,
akin to corn, <i>Zea mays L.</i>, than the New World.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_28" href="#fn_11_28">[28]</a> Another
argument is that though the Chinese kept a careful
record of the importation of various plants such as
tobacco and the opium poppy, there is no mention of
corn, implying that they had long been familiar with
some variety of it.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_29" href="#fn_11_29">[29]</a> The botanist Edgar Anderson believes
it could have originated in Burma, and could
have come across the Pacific &ldquo;along with cotton, pottery,
weaving, etc.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_30" href="#fn_11_30">[30]</a> Anderson&rsquo;s evidence, as he himself
<span class="pb" id="Page_275">275</span>
maintains, is not conclusive; but it is certainly suggestive.
Popcorn is found today among primitive or
backward peoples in the remoter parts of Formosa,
Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Burma. From the Naga
Hills, where Burma meets Assam, Anderson has had
brought to the United States cobs and kernels of popcorn
which are identical with the corn found in the
earliest graves in Peru. Was this Burmese popcorn carried
eastward over the Pacific thousands of years ago
and then crossed with some American plant, such as
<i>Tripsacum</i>, to produce the great variety of larger and
more useful types that the Spaniards found? Or was
popcorn, imported from the New World, the only
maize that the primitive Naga of Burma would cultivate?</p>
<p>The argument for a Burmese origin for popcorn is
strengthened by some habits of the Naga tribesmen
which carry us back to the dispute over diffusion versus
independent invention. These people, living in the
Stone Age today, follow the agricultural pattern of the
pre-Columbian Indian. They burn trees and underbrush
to clear their fields. They use a digging stick to
plant their corn in the charred rubbish. In amongst the
corn they grow cereals and cotton.<a class="fn" id="fr_11_31" href="#fn_11_31">[31]</a> On the other
hand, they could have taken their corn to the New
World long before the men of Bat Cave ate maize
6500 years ago.</p>
<p>Yet, if it should prove true that popcorn came to the
Americas as the first form of maize, we should still have
to credit the Indian with the tedious centuries&mdash;even
millenniums&mdash;that went into the production of the
many varieties which covered thousands of square
miles of the New World when Columbus heard of &ldquo;a
sort of grain they call maiz.&rdquo; And, before the coming of
corn from Asia, we should still have to recognize the
tens of centuries that went into the discovery and development
<span class="pb" id="Page_276">276</span>
of the agriculture of beans, squash, melons,
potatoes, and manioc.</p>
<p>The story of corn and of agriculture does not tell us
just when early man reached our hemisphere; but it
suggests that he must have settled in South America
thousands of years before the birth of Christ. He
needed many millenniums to evolve from a hunting
and gathering savage into a farmer and to reach the
cultural level at which he would develop and perfect
the many varieties of corn. These millenniums may
stretch back to the last interglacial&mdash;if an astounding
discovery in the Valley of Mexico can be accepted. According
to Mangelsdorf, a drill core from more than
200 feet below ground contained fossilized grains of
pollen. Elso Barghoom has identified them as corn. The
geological level where the core was taken is &ldquo;probably
at least 80,000 years old.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_11_32" href="#fn_11_32">[32]</a></p>

<h3>The Pendulum Swings</h3>
<p>This chapter might have been
headed &ldquo;Summary.&rdquo; We could not have called it &ldquo;Conclusions,&rdquo;
for, as we read the record of early man, we
saw the damage that had been done by too rash
appraisals. The final pages will review the more important
evidence of early man in the New World, including
his relation to Old World peoples and to certain
geologic phenomena.</p>
<p>The study of early man in America has suffered from
alternate spasms of unscientific enthusiasm and far
too &ldquo;scientific&rdquo; caution. It has ranged from the parading
of rumor and guesswork to the blind cranioclasm of
Hrdli&#269;ka. In the nineteenth century the talk was of
man in the Americas before the Great Ice Age and far
back into the Tertiary era that ended 1,000,000 years
ago. At the beginning of the twentieth century anthropologists
gave him no more than 4,000 years in the
New World. Now they generally concede him 10,000
or 15,000 years, and many grant him 25,000 or more.</p>
<p>Clark Wissler, in <i>The Origin of the American Indian</i>,
wrote, &ldquo;The first great migration of Old World
peoples to the New can be set down as not only beginning
<span class="pb" id="Page_278">278</span>
but culminating within the limits of late Pleistocene
Time.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_1" href="#fn_12_1">[1]</a> Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., long a protagonist
of Folsom man, wrote the next year, &ldquo;The belief
that the Folsom complex developed towards the end
of the Pleistocene, or Late Glacial, period and carried
over into the beginning of the Recent is now more or
less generally accepted.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_2" href="#fn_12_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>On the whole, the archaeologists&mdash;developing a new
and sound technique in stratigraphic excavation and
pottery study&mdash;have held back more than the physical
anthropologists from the acceptance of a variegated array
of early men at quite early dates. Geologists and
paleontologists, in whose hands must lie the final dating
of the Indian&rsquo;s predecessors, have inclined to a
more radical attitude. A few scientists are talking of
the possibility that man crossed Bering Strait before the
last glaciation&mdash;W&uuml;rm in Europe, Wisconsin in America&mdash;and
possibly even while the Riss-Illinois was laying
a land-bridge across from Siberia to Alaska.</p>
<p>At last, through chemist Willard Libby and his radiocarbon,
we are getting some dependable dates for
early man and earlier mammals. Yet disagreements
continue. When you look at the evidence behind the
conflicting opinions of scientists&mdash;at skulls, tools, fossils,
and earth strata, all too innocent of Carbon&sup1;&#8308;&mdash;you
see why there had to be disagreements. We have
facts about early man, plenty of them. Some are conflicting
facts. Most of them raise serious problems. A
few leave us with grievous puzzles. Let us reexamine
the facts and puzzles.</p>
<h3>The Puzzle of the Skulls</h3>
<p>We have quite a few skulls
that may have belonged to early man. On the whole,
they do not look as Mongoloid as good Indian skulls
should. Except for two&mdash;Minnesota man and Tepexpan
man&mdash;they are long-headed instead of round-headed,
and those exceptions lie between the two extremes.
<span class="pb" id="Page_279">279</span>
The skulls have heavy brow ridges. Most of
them have keeled vaults like the Australoid-Melanesians
of today. Many have retreating foreheads. It is
true that skulls like these can be found in the variegated
ranks of what is supposed to be the homogeneous
&ldquo;Indian race&rdquo;; but they are far from plentiful. For instance,
Hrdli&#269;ka&rsquo;s catalogue of Indian craniums shows
only a small percentage that are long-headed. If early
man was indeed more Australoid-Melanesian in type
than pure Mongoloid, it would be only natural to find
some reflection in the descendants of the Mongoloid
immigrants with whom early man may be presumed
to have bred.</p>
<p>There is no agreement as to the racial affinities of
the earliest migrants. Most anthropologists still believe
they were Mongoloids and therefore what they call Indians.
Some go to the other extreme and declare they
were Australoid, Negroid, and/or Caucasoid. Some,
like Hooton, say the stock was drawn from a mingling
of the three races in Asia. He thinks they &ldquo;may have
received some Mongoloid admixture before reaching
the New World, but this is doubtful.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_3" href="#fn_12_3">[3]</a></p>
<p>Many of the skulls of early man resemble in certain
respects those of that late arrival, the Eskimo, just as
the Eskimo resembles some specimens of Magdalenian
man. The skulls of the Eskimo are long-headed, and
have keeled vaults and prominent cheekbones. But
most early craniums have three features that are lacking
in the Eskimo&mdash;receding chins, slanting foreheads
and heavy brow ridges&mdash;all stigmata of the Australoid-Melanesian.</p>
<p>It is rather puzzling to note that these early skulls
are found with the bones of extinct animals in South
America, but seldom with such fossils in North America,
while they are not found with Folsom or Sandia or
any form of ancient point. (There seem few points of
definite-early type in South America.) It is possible,
<span class="pb" id="Page_280">280</span>
as Howard suggested, that the North American
hunters practiced exposure of the dead instead of burial,
while early man to the south left more burials for
us than the few that have been found.</p>
<h3>The Puzzle of the Querns</h3>
<p>The next puzzle lies in the
milling stones. Man in America not only starts off with
an exceptionally fine type of spear point to thrust into
elephant or bison, and uses pressure flaking far more
extensively than man in the Old World; in addition,
he develops the type of milling stone, or quern, that
does not appear in Europe until man is coming out of
the Old Stone Age and entering the neolithic period of
agriculture. Milling stones might be used as an argument
against the early appearance of man in America
if it could be proved that they were made to grind agricultural
products; but no kernels of corn or other cultivated
seeds have been found with these querns.</p>
<p>Except for milling stones that seem to have been
used to grind paint in Chile,<a class="fn" id="fr_12_4" href="#fn_12_4">[4]</a> the preagricultural
querns occur mainly in the area of California, the
Southwest, and upper Mexico. Through California,
from Borax Lake and the Mohave Desert, to the
Cochise area of southeastern Arizona and the Edwards
Plateau of central Texas, and on into northwestern
Mexico, these grinding tools turn up with artifacts and
in geological strata that may be from 6,000 to 25,000
years old. If those dates are correct, then we have milling
stones in the New World many years before there
was any agriculture. The explanation must be that
some of the earliest of the Americans were food gatherers
and grinders of nuts and seeds as well as hunters.
In addition to their querns, they have left us hearths on
beds of collected stones, rude knives, rough percussion
tools such as scrapers and choppers, but very few spear
points. There is no early culture of this sort now known
in Asia or Africa. It is not Folsom. Is it Australoid? Does
<span class="pb" id="Page_281">281</span>
it go back to a type of people who, in some hybrid and
degenerate form, settled Australia? At least we know
that the culture of the Australians is a curious mixture
of very primitive traits with some elements of the polished
stone work of the New Stone Age and milling
stones. They are nearer being food gatherers than
hunters.</p>
<h3>The Puzzle of the Points</h3>
<p>With the first hunters in the
New World&mdash;the men who made the Sandia, the Folsom,
the Plainview, and probably the early Eden
points&mdash;we come to another puzzle. The Sandia is
shaped like a much superior point made by the Solutreans
of Europe and an equally crude one made in
Africa, but the best Folsom is better than the best
Solutrean. The fluted channels of the Folsom are remarkable
enough; in addition, the edges are sharpened
by the removal of almost microscopic flakes, and
the base is often carefully ground. We know that such
points were being made at least 10,000 and perhaps
15,000 years ago. The Eden point is doubtless newer,
yet it must antedate the only chipped weapons that
can equal it, the daggers of neolithic Egyptians 7,500
years ago or of the still later Danes.</p>
<p>A point with Eden-like chipping has been found in
a neolithic site in Siberia.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_5" href="#fn_12_5">[5]</a> What does this mean? Obviously
Sandia man or his forebears came from Asia
across Bering Strait, but too early to leave the Siberian
Eden behind him. Someone has been bold enough to
suggest that the descendants of the man who developed
the Folsom point may have returned to Siberia;
after all, as George Gaylord Simpson has pointed out,
a bridge works both ways.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_6" href="#fn_12_6">[6]</a> If Eden man was too late
for the land-bridge of the last glaciation, he still had
the ice-bridge of winter. But &ldquo;ice&rdquo; suggests a doubt.
Would a hunter of the temperate High Plains be likely
to trek north through the chill of winter to deposit a
<span class="pb" id="Page_282">282</span>
spear point in Siberia? Yet we know that traces of Eden,
Plainview, and Folsom have been found in Alaska.
Were they left by summer transients fishing Cook Inlet
or hunting Alaskan jaguar around Fairbanks? It is safer,
on the whole, to ask where this type of early American
came from than to ask where he went.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig87">
<img src="images/i068.jpg" alt="" width="349" height="599" />
<p class="pcapc"><i>Left, a point with oblique chipping in the Eden style,
found near Lake Baikal, Siberia, in a neolithic culture, compared
with an Eden point from Colorado. Is the resemblance
accidental, or could Eden man have migrated to the
Old World after developing his characteristic style of flint
knapping in the New? The size of the Siberian point is not
recorded. (The Eden point, after Howard, 1935; the Siberian,
after Okladnikov, 1938, and Collins, 1943.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>The points of early man present a double puzzle.
How did it happen that the art of working flint was
brought to higher perfection in the New World during
the Old Stone Age than it was in the Old World?
And where did these consummate flint knappers come
from? The first question may never be answered. The
<span class="pb" id="Page_283">283</span>
second presents interesting possibilities. They revolve
around the brief appearance of the Solutreans in Europe.
Only a great deal of very thorough excavation
in Siberia will give us more than provocative or provoking
theories about the origins of the men who made
Sandia and Folsom points.</p>
<h3>Was Our Early Man a Solutrean?</h3>
<p>Let us stress again
that the Folsom and Eden chipping reached a perfection
unknown in Europe until neolithic man brought in
agriculture. Indeed, if the paleolithic Solutrean points
had never been found, <i>all</i> American archaeologists&mdash;instead
of just one or two&mdash;might unhesitatingly have
called Folsom and Eden neolithic, even though they
were found with extinct animals. In the history of Europe&rsquo;s
Old Stone Age&mdash;and in Africa&rsquo;s, too, for that matter&mdash;we
have no more than one hint of such work. It
was only the men of the Solutrean culture&mdash;thrust between
the late Aurignacian and the early Magdalenian&mdash;who
took much true advantage of pressure flaking,
and who made spear points with Sandia-like shoulders.
(While the flint chipping of the Solutreans is fine, it is
not so minute or so perfect as the work of the men who
made Folsom and Eden points.) With the disappearance
of the Solutreans, the art of fine flint knapping
and point making faded away in the Old World, not
to appear again with any vigor until neolithic times.</p>
<p>The Solutreans are not a part of the flow and development
of prehistoric European culture. They seem
to come as invaders, and then fade out after 500 years,
or, at the most, 10,000. Where they came from is uncertain.
Because crude points called Proto-Solutrean
are much more plentiful along the Danube than they
are in France&mdash;where the finest Solutrean work is found&mdash;it
has long been argued that the people who made
them came from western Asia. Lately, flint work of the
Solutrean type has been discovered in Morocco and
<span class="pb" id="Page_284">284</span>
also in Egypt;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_7" href="#fn_12_7">[7]</a> and, since it is intermixed with the
products of a much older culture, the Mousterian, it
may be argued that the Solutreans came from Africa.
The theory of an eastern origin remains strong, however;
for among the African flints are shouldered
points, and shouldered points were not developed until
the end of the Solutrean period in Europe. We do not
know the date of the Mousterian in Africa; it may have
been late.</p>
<p>If the Solutreans did, in fact, originate in Asia, can
we believe that an Asiatic people with an unusual flair
for flint knapping fathered both the Solutreans and the
men who made the Sandia and the far finer Folsom
and Eden points? Did this parent stock send a group
of migrants across Bering Strait and down into the
High Plains to give us Folsom, Sandia, and Eden
points? Did it throw off toward the west a group that
practiced the Solutrean arts in Europe? Even after archaeologists
have dug Siberia thoroughly we may
never know how much earlier or later the American
offshoot appeared on the High Plains than the Solutreans
in Europe.</p>
<p>It is a curious fact that the Solutreans were as negligent
as the Folsom and Eden men in providing us
with skulls. C. S. Coon writes, &ldquo;There are no skulls
which all authorities accept as definitely belonging to
that short and far from widespread cultural phase.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_8" href="#fn_12_8">[8]</a>
Hunters in Europe, like hunters in America, seem to
have taken little interest in formal obsequies and
proper burials. Nature consumed their remains.</p>
<h3>Or Was the American Aurignacian or Magdalenian?</h3>
<p>Even before the discovery of Folsom made early man
in America look like a fugitive from that village in
France called Solutr&eacute;, anthropologists were struck by
other resemblances. In 1924 the Englishman Sollas
compared the Eskimo culture with the Magdalenian.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_9" href="#fn_12_9">[9]</a>
<span class="pb" id="Page_285">285</span>
In 1932 Hrdli&#269;ka was writing of an Aurignacian and
Magdalenian ancestry for the American Indian.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_10" href="#fn_12_10">[10]</a> In
1933 N. C. Nelson was playing with such comparisons,
and writing of our &ldquo;wooden spear and spear-thrower,
perhaps of Magdalenian affinity; our three out of four
forms of Solutrean chipped blades; our ordinary Aurignacian-like
endscraper; our simple Mousterian type
flake; and, finally, our Abbevillian and Chellean varieties
of the <i>coup-de-poing</i>.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_11" href="#fn_12_11">[11]</a> In the same year Harrington
was going further. Recalling that in 1921 he
had reported flint work in Cuba that was Aurignacian
in style, Harrington pointed out that the Solutrean
never reached the West Indies. &ldquo;Man in a Magdalenian
stage of development ... reached America, probably
via Asia, but perhaps from Europe via Iceland and
Greenland. These bands kept to the north, following up
the retreating glaciers, and became the ancestors of the
Eskimo.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_12" href="#fn_12_12">[12]</a> Thomas Jefferson had somewhat the same
idea when he wrote that the Eskimos &ldquo;must be derived
from the Groenlanders, and these probably from some
of the northern parts of the old continent.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_13" href="#fn_12_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>Must we add the Aurignacians and Magdalenians of
the end of the New Stone Age to the Solutreans and
the Australoids as early invaders of America? The answer
is dubious, for as yet northern Asia has yielded
only a little evidence of the Aurignacian and the
Magdalenian.</p>
<h3>Chopping Tools Instead of Hand Axes in Asia</h3>
<div class="pb" id="Page_286">286</div>
<div class="img" id="fig88">
<img src="images/i069.jpg" alt="" width="700" height="618" />
<p class="pcapc"><i>Showing the areas where the hand ax dominated and
those where the chopping tool took precedence. The white
portions are the ice fields of the last glaciation. (After
Movius, 1944.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Throughout most of Asia the men of the Old Stone Age
developed a very different core industry from that of
Europe. Instead of the hand ax (<i>coup-de-poing</i>), they
made an implement now called a chopping tool. This
was a large and somewhat flat pebble with a sharpened
edge made by striking off flakes alternately from either
side. They had also large, crude scrapers, flaked on a
single side, which are now called choppers. Only in India
and the Near East did the hand ax seem to flourish
as in western Europe and much of Africa. In the border
area of the Upper Punjab, Helmut de Terra found
both hand axes and chopping tools in the early Soan
culture, which seems to lie in the Second Interglacial.
In upper Burma the hand ax disappears, leaving the
field to the chopping tool and the chopper. The same
seems true of Java and northern China.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_14" href="#fn_12_14">[14]</a> Here there
are flake artifacts, but they were not chipped by European
methods. On the whole, the tools of the Asiatic
complex look much more like the choppers and scrapers
found at very early sites such as Lake Mohave,
<span class="pb" id="Page_287">287</span>
southeastern Arizona (Cochise), Sonora, Lower California,
and the Valley of Mexico.</p>

<p class="pcapc"><i>A chopping tool of the early Soan culture, in northwestern
India. (After Paterson, 1942.)</i></p>
</div>
<p>Yet&mdash;another puzzle&mdash;hand axes have been found in
central and southern Texas, and in Renaud&rsquo;s Black&rsquo;s
Fork culture of Wyoming, without traces of Folsom or
Eden. Can these hand axes, like the Aurignacian and
Magdalenian traits of which Nelson and Harrington
write, represent an earlier migration than Sandia and
Folsom? This is most problematical.</p>
<h3>Spinden&rsquo;s Neolithic Blockade</h3>
<p>All this is patently absurd
to the dean of American archaeologists, Herbert
J. Spinden. If tools in the New World resemble the Aurignacian
or the Solutrean, it is an accident&mdash;perhaps
an accident of psychic unity. He is against all talk of
paleolithic man in the Americas on the late edge of
the Great Ice Age. In the face of facts presented by
Russian and American glacialists, he maintains that
&ldquo;eastern Siberia was rather heavily glaciated.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_15" href="#fn_12_15">[15]</a> He
believes that certain Asiatic peoples with a sudden
urge for travel first appeared at the Siberian-Alaskan
portal about 2500 <span class="small">B.C.</span><a class="fn" id="fr_12_16" href="#fn_12_16">[16]</a> They could not have been
men of the Old Stone Age because, he asserts, we have
found nothing in Siberia that approaches the paleolithic;
<span class="pb" id="Page_288">288</span>
indeed, we have found no paleolithic tools north
of 54&deg; in England, of 53&deg; in Siberia, or of 43&deg; on
the Sea of Japan, while &ldquo;the portal to America for
man and beast lies at 67&deg; north latitude.&rdquo; We have,
then, &ldquo;a no-proof barrier zone a thousand miles deep
extending clear across the Old World.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_17" href="#fn_12_17">[17]</a> This &ldquo;rules
out invasion of America until relatively modern times
because it shows that a wide zone of the Old World,
blocking the road to America, was itself unused by
man until long after the last continental ice sheet
... had disappeared.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_18" href="#fn_12_18">[18]</a> Obviously, Spinden&rsquo;s argument
is not based on evidence in the Americas, but
rather on lack of evidence in little studied Siberia.
He ignores the presence of paleolithic tools in northern
Manchuria together with the fossils of extinct
mammals.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_19" href="#fn_12_19">[19]</a> He concedes that even in the regions of
&ldquo;the most ancient civilization&rdquo; in the Old World there
is no trace of such high technical skill in flint chipping
as the Folsom &ldquo;before the fourth millennium before
Christ.&rdquo; But&mdash;appearing to ignore the geological
evidence connected with Sandia, Folsom, Clovis, Abilene,
and Lake Mohave&mdash;he interprets this as meaning
that man cannot have reached the Southwest before
the golden age of Ur. He speaks of &ldquo;the lost cause
of paleolithic man in America.&rdquo; He accepts Solutrean
flint work as paleolithic, but not Folsom or Eden. &ldquo;Now,
even if we admit that Folsom man hunted the mammoth,
we must place that sporting event not earlier
than 2000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_20" href="#fn_12_20">[20]</a></p>
<h3>Was the First Migration Interglacial?</h3>
<p>As we think we
have shown in <a href="#c10">Chapter 8</a>, we can never hope to date
early man at all exactly by means of elephants or bison
or any other extinct mammal. Even if science were able
to settle the time of the great extinction, we should
be only a little better off. We could say that man was
in the New World at that time; but this would give
<span class="pb" id="Page_289">289</span>
us only an upper date, not a lower one. Man may have
been here for tens of thousands of years before those
mammals died off. A few scientists think he was.</p>
<p>The great glaciations presented early man with an
opportunity and a difficulty; they threw a land-bridge
across Bering Strait, but, for long periods of time, they
also laid a barrier of ice and snow across his path to
the south. Look at the map at the top of <a class="pgref" href="#Page_26">page 26</a> and
you will see that about 65,000 years ago the barrier covered
the whole depth of Canada. This would have
meant a trip of some 2,000 miles across ice. For a time,
as we have explained earlier, a corridor opened up for
his passage. By 18,000 years ago, however, it had
closed again. To be sure, there was a tongue of ice-free
land that ran southward across part of Canada and
shortened the journey over snow and ice to a thousand
miles; but the invader would have had to be extremely
lucky to hit the upper end of the open country. Far
more important, none of the animals that he hunted,
and that therefore led him on his southward journey,
would have taken that thousand-mile trek across a
frozen, foodless waste. If early man came in the time
of the corridor, his trip would not have been too difficult
and he would have found game along the way. At
any period he could have come by boat or possibly
afoot along the Pacific coast. But, no matter how he
came, he would have faced almost insuperable difficulties
during the first quarter and the third quarter of
the last glaciation.</p>
<p>This fact affects different students differently. Antevs,
feeling that man must have come after the ice
began to melt, gives our migrant not much over 15,000
years in the New World. If man arrived earlier, he
feels, it must have been when the corridor opened
through the ice some 40,000 years ago, and he sees no
evidence for so early a migration.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_21" href="#fn_12_21">[21]</a> Kirk Bryan disagrees.
Accepting the theory that the last glaciation
<span class="pb" id="Page_290">290</span>
waxed and waned three times, he places the first invasion
by man in the second of these wanings, or inter-stadials,
just before the final burgeoning of the ice 12,000
years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_22" href="#fn_12_22">[22]</a> Sauer goes further. He suggests that
the shores of western Siberia may have been inhabited
during the second interglacial, and that during the
third glaciation, preceding the Wisconsin, &ldquo;a first
colonization of the New World is not improbable.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_23" href="#fn_12_23">[23]</a>
Erwin H. Barbour and C. Bertrand Schultz say that
&ldquo;evidence is constantly accumulating to show that man
actually had reached North America before the last
glacial advance.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_24" href="#fn_12_24">[24]</a> George F. Carter believes that artifacts
in the glacial gravels of Trenton and Lake Lahontan,
spear points with musk oxen in New Mexico, the
Vero skull partnered in Florida with flora and fauna
more appropriate to Pennsylvania, stone implements
deeply buried under aged soil profiles, all argue that
man was in North America during the last glaciation.
He does not believe that primitive hunters&mdash;let alone
the Cochise food gatherers&mdash;would have survived Arctic
travel at the height of the glaciations. He thinks that
Folsom man came through the ice-free corridor of
40,000 years ago, and that another body of immigrants
came during the last of the three great interglacials,
which means about 100,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_25" href="#fn_12_25">[25]</a></p>
<p>Interglacial migration finds support from Albrecht
Penck, the German glacialist who with Eduard Br&uuml;ckner
established the four great glaciations of central Europe.
Penck gives two reasons for believing that man
came to the Americas in the last interglacial. Both
theories lie outside his field of special knowledge.</p>
<p>First, Penck doubts that man had time enough after
the glaciers melted to adapt himself to the seven or
eight climates in which he lived and labored in 1492.
In the 10,000 years since the Wisconsin glaciation, people
of an arctic habitat could not possibly have adjusted
their physical nature so perfectly &ldquo;first to forests,
<span class="pb" id="Page_291">291</span>
then to steppes and deserts in temperate zones, then
to steaming tropical forests and to the plateaus of the
tropics, the steppes and deserts of the southern hemisphere,
and finally to the damp, cool south.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Penck&rsquo;s second reason for supporting interglacial migration
has to do with the marked changes of climate
that took pace during the Great Ice Age. As the glaciers
grew and moved farther and farther south, the
temperature belts of Canada and the United States
moved south with them. As these belts moved, vegetation
altered. Tundra crept to the south, pursuing
grasslands and forest. Deserts and jungle moved before
them. When the glaciers began to melt, this movement
went into reverse. Penck feels that primitive man
migrates easily only within a single climatic zone. Tundra
folk avoid forests; forest folk avoid tundra. Man
moves with the climate, not against it; a New Yorker
goes to Florida in the winter, not the summer. Early
man would not have traveled southward through
Canada and the United States while the climate was
moving northward with the melting of the ice. On the
contrary, man would have moved southward only as
the glaciers grew and the temperature belts moved
southward. When the glaciers melted he would have
tended to move northward again. Thus man must have
entered the New World toward the end of an interglacial,
and gone southward with the weather. After
that, shifts in the climate would have distributed man
all over the Americas. &ldquo;Under the influence of a number
of alternating glacial and interglacial periods, we
can understand the gradual settlement, but not solely
on the assumption of one glacial migration.&rdquo; With the
end of the last glaciers men spread north and south
once more, and even drifted back to Asia.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_26" href="#fn_12_26">[26]</a> Penck&rsquo;s
argument becomes all the stronger if we grant that
early man followed the animals he killed for food and
<span class="pb" id="Page_292">292</span>
animals followed the movements of the vegetation on
which they fed.</p>
<p>Further, the presence of early man close to the time
and even the edge of the retreating glaciers&mdash;if the
evidence is read aright&mdash;argues that he must have arrived
in North America during one of those retreats
of the Wisconsin glaciation which preceded its final
growth and decline.</p>
<h3>Geological Evidence and the Pluvials</h3>
<p>All this is speculation,
of course&mdash;reasoned speculation, but no more
than that. Are we on firmer ground when we deal with
geological evidence? Perhaps, yet there is plenty of
room for controversy.</p>
<p>The New World has very few sites in which artifacts
or human bones have been found in glacial gravels. A
noted one, near Trenton, New Jersey, has been under
dispute for eighty years. The Lake Lahontan site and
its blade have been too much neglected. There are,
however, a number of places where skulls or artifacts
have been found linked to other strata than gravels
that suggest a relationship with glacial activity.</p>
<p>In these sites we find human skulls or artifacts together
with signs of much rainfall or of large lakes and
rivers which now have no more existence than the
mammoth. The evidence of man lay undisturbed beneath
sterile layers of material deposited by water. A
typical case is Sandia Cave. Here Folsom points were
found beneath a floor of a stalagmitic limestone
created by so heavy a seepage of calcium-charged water
that the stratum holding the Folsom material had
been partially consolidated. Below lies another sterile
layer&mdash;of yellow ocher earth, indicating a very moist
period and the presence of trees which would provide
certain chemical agents and which are no more common
now in this arid area than are heavy, continuous
rains. Another example of mans association with a
<span class="pb" id="Page_293">293</span>
much moister time than the present comes from the
cave in Brazil where the Confins skull was found. The
skull lay under six feet of alluvial soil carried in by water.
Later a layer of stalagmitic limestone sealed the
sepulcher. It may be presumed that artifacts found
on the shore or in the clay of Lake Cochise, Lake Mohave,
and Pinto Basin&mdash;now dry and gone&mdash;must have
been made during a time of great waters.</p>
<p>What do such evidences of unusual moisture mean?
They mean that the men of these sites lived before or
during a period of heavy rainfall not known there for
at least the last 9000 years. Beyond that bare fact,
debate begins. Walter, Cathoud, and Mattos, who described
the Brazilian find, took a most conservative attitude
and wrote that Confins man lived &ldquo;a few thousands
of years ago.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_27" href="#fn_12_27">[27]</a> Bryan, who studied Sandia Cave,
placed the later wet period after the end of Pleistocene,
or Great Ice Age, and the first wet period&mdash;along with
the Sandia points&mdash;in the Late glacial.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_28" href="#fn_12_28">[28]</a></p>
<p>Glacial experts call a period of unusual and widespread
rains a pluvial. They believe that the growth of
the glaciers was accompanied by pluvials, and some
maintain that pluvials also marked the melting of the
ice. Antevs lists a great pluvial&mdash;the Bonneville&mdash;which
formed Lake Bonneville and Lake Lahontan during
the first maximum of the last, or Wisconsin, glaciation,
65,000 years ago. He places another period of great
moisture, the Provo Pluvial, at the last glacial maximum,
about 12,000 years ago, and believes it was all
but spent 7,000 to 9,000 years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_29" href="#fn_12_29">[29]</a> Thus he dates
Lake Mohave and its early artifacts about 9,000 years
ago. His point is that annual precipitation is about the
same throughout the globe, but that the pluvials shift
at various times. &ldquo;It is essentially the location of the
rainfall that changes.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_12_30" href="#fn_12_30">[30]</a></p>
<p>All authorities do not agree that annual rainfall is
constant, and some deny Antev&rsquo;s late date for the last
<span class="pb" id="Page_294">294</span>
pluvial. Sauer writes, &ldquo;I know of no climatologic basis
for postulating a postglacial pluvial period,&rdquo; either in
New Mexico or the Lake Mohave and Pinto Basin area
of southern California.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_31" href="#fn_12_31">[31]</a> Some European authorities
believe that pluvials are entirely glacial. M. C. Burkitt,
for example, cites the fact that the same type of tools
is found in Africa during pluvials as in Europe during
glacials.<a class="fn" id="fr_12_32" href="#fn_12_32">[32]</a> According to Simpson&rsquo;s theory of the formation
of the glaciers, rainfall increased enormously during
two periods of the Great Ice Age; the last pluvial
was at its height during the building up of the W&uuml;rm-Wisconsin
ice sheets. (See <a class="pgref" href="#Page_58">page 58</a>.) The pluvials
make a rather good case for early man in the New
World during the last glaciation.</p>
<h3>In Sum</h3>
<p>Ten years ago, we knew that men in America
had once killed, skinned, and eaten animals now extinct,
for we had found their weapons and a few of
their bones mingled with the fossils of mammals long
extinct. We could not question the association, because
it often involved the remains of campfires; spear points
and bones might be moved about in the course of time,
but not fragile heaps of charcoal. We knew, too, that
the bones and tools of man had been found sealed
away by the chemistry of the ages. But when we tried
to date man securely by animals that were dead and
gone, or by the earths that lay above him, we began to
guess. The guesses of conservative glacialists gave him
at least 15,000 years in the New World. Other speculations&mdash;supported
by rather plausible evidence as well
as not implausible theory&mdash;placed him still earlier.
Now, at last, through the miraculous time clock of radiocarbon,
we know that man was here before the chill
of the last Ice Age settled upon the land.</p>

<p>This eminently readable and authoritative
book on the Stone Age American
has been extensively revised and updated
for this new edition. <b>Early Man
in the New World</b> examines and assesses
the prevailing theories on the appearance
of man in America during the late
Ice Age, and his relationship to the
present-day American Indian. With
ninety-five line drawings depicting the
different stone-flaking techniques, illustrating
various migration routes, and
locating fossil sites, this is an incomparable
guide to a continuing archaeological
quest. &ldquo;An admirable introduction,&rdquo;
wrote Harry L. Shapiro in The
<b>Saturday Review</b>; <b>The New York Times</b>
called it &ldquo;excellent and provocative.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>KENNETH MACGOWAN</b> is an outstanding
amateur archaeologist with a special
talent for clarifying the complex mass
of evidence and the conflicting theories
on the existence of prehistoric man in
America. His vocation has been producing
plays on Broadway and motion pictures
in Hollywood. He is professor
emeritus of theater arts at U.C.L.A., and
the author of several books.</p>
<p><b>JOSEPH A. HESTER, JR.</b>, Mr. Macgowan&rsquo;s
collaborator on this revised edition, is
an associate professor of anthropology
at San Jose State College. Dr. Hester is
a member of the Society for American
Archaeology and a fellow of the American
Anthropological Association.</p>
<p>The foreword to this edition is by <b>Gordon
Ekholm</b>, Curator of Mexican Archaeology,
Department of Anthropology, American
Museum of Natural History.</p>
<hr />
<p>Though best known for his distinguished career in the
theater and motion pictures, Kenneth Macgowan has
won the respect of professional archaeologists and anthropologists
for his special talent in explaining to fellow
amateurs the search for prehistoric man in North
and South America. First published in 1950, <span class="sc">Early
Man in the New World</span> has now been extensively
revised to include the wealth of new finds in the last
decade.</p>
<p>Mr. Macgowan made his reputation first as a dramatic
critic for such publications as <i>Vogue</i> and <i>Theatre
Arts</i>, then as a Broadway and Hollywood producer.
Since 1947 he has been professor of theater arts at
U.C.L.A.</p>
<p class="tb">Joseph A. Hester, Jr., is associate professor of anthropology
at San Jose State College. He has taught
at Occidental College, Stanford University, and at
U.C.L.A. He received his A.B. degree in 1949 and his
Ph.D. degree in 1954 from U.C.L.A., both in anthropology.
From 1952 to 1954, Dr. Hester held a fellowship
in archaeology with the Carnegie Institution of
Washington, and later in 1955-56, a post-doctoral fellowship
with the National Science Foundation. He is
a member of the Society for American Archaeology
and a fellow of the American Anthropological Association.</p>

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
